You	and	Trapper	Education



Trapping is enjoyable and it provides a variety of benefits to those with the knowledge and 

ability to do it well. But, if trapping is not done right, it can cause bad feelings towards trappers 
and trapping. Therefore, trapping is a serious business. The future of trapping depends on the 
way  you as a trapper perform. 


Successful completion of a trapper education course is required of all first time trappers in New 
York State. This requirement started in 1980 to increase awareness of the trapper’s 
responsibilities and to introduce beginning trappers to acceptable trapping methods, ethics and 
responsibilities, laws and regulations, natural history, and basic wildlife management principles. 


All of these things provide a good start for new trappers. Trapping skill, however, must be 
developed through experience after the course. The things you learn in this course will help 
make trapping more enjoyable and help make you more successful. 

Through this course, you can learn more about the tradition and adventure of trapping, increase 

your environmental awareness, gain new outdoor skills, and maybe even make some money. In 
addition, there is the opportunity for personal development through hard work, careful study, 
and a better understanding of nature and wildlife. It is hoped   the course will also encourage 

beginning trappers to learn more about trapping from personal experience and the experience 
of others. 

You can learn even more about trapping from information you can get from your instructor,

9,"Chapter	2	History	of	Trapping



Since prehistoric times, human beings have used traps of various kinds to capture animals for 
food, clothing, or population control. The earliest forms of traps were probably pits, deadfalls or 
snares. Of these three trap types, only snares, now called cable restraints or cable traps, are still 

commonly used today. 

When Europeans first came to North America, they depended on the plentiful furbearer 
resources. The demand for fur in Europe, especially beaver, created a large and thriving fur 

trade in North America from which Native Americans and some of the new immigrants derived a 
portion of their livelihood. 

It was the lure of richer hunting and trapping territories, particularly for beaver, more than the 
lure of rich soil or even gold that prompted westward exploration and settlement. Along the 

paths opened by these pioneering trappers, first commerce and then agriculture spread across 
the nation. 

During the 1800s, groups of trappers and explorers known as “mountain men,” many armed 

                                                          with Newhouse traps, journeyed up the 
                                                          Missouri River to explore the beaver 
                                                          meadows of the Rocky Mountains from 

                                                          Canada to New Mexico. The “golden age 
                                                          of fur” saw native people both 
                                                          befriended and exploited, trappers 

                                                          survived hardships to make or to lose 
                                                          fortunes, and many lives lost all for the 
                                                          sake of fur. 


New York State has a rich history in the fur trade. In the mid‐ 1600s, the area now occupied by 
Albany, our state capital, was known as Beverwyck in recognition of the volume of fur that 
flowed through the region. Even today, the official seal of Albany depicts a beaver cutting down 

a tree, a clear connection to the significant role trapping played in the exploration and 
development of the Empire State. Also, the Newhouse traps used by the mountain men of the 
1800s were manufactured in the Oneida, N.Y. area. 


Thanks to sound wildlife management, large populations of furbearers still exist, and many 
people depend on trapping them to supplement their income. Well‐regulated hunting and 
trapping provide pleasurable and profitable means of using a renewable natural resource

11,"Chapter	3	Furbearer	Management



The	Furbearer	Resource

New York State is fortunate to have an abundance of furbearers, including muskrat, mink, 
beaver, otter, opossum, skunk, raccoon, gray fox, red fox, coyote, weasel, fisher, bobcat and 
marten. These animals have a number of effects upon the environment, economics, and the 

quality of human life in addition to their furvalue. With the exception of beaver and muskrat, 
most furbearers are predators which are important to maintaining ecological balance in natural 
systems. 

Any discussion of the value of furbearers must 

consider both their beneficial and harmful effects. 
Beaver may flood valuable agricultural lands, 
homes, roadways, woodlands, and in some 

instances, have detrimental impacts to trout 
populations. However, their ponds create valuable 
habitat for animals such as mink, muskrat, and 

otter and many species of birds. Muskrat eat 
aquatic vegetation, often opening up portions of 
marshes creating habitat for fish and wildlife. However, muskrats can be extremely destructive 

to the banks and  dikes of man‐made ponds and lakes. Predatory furbearers, which must kill 
other animals to eat, may prey on domestic stock, game animals or other valued or rare wildlife. 
In some areas, coyotes may cause losses of free‐ranging stock such as sheep or chickens. 

Coyotes can play a positive role by controlling mice and other rodents. The corn and songbird 
depredations of raccoon and skunk must be balanced against their controlling effects on insects 
and rodents. Another negative concern is that furbearers sometimes carry diseases like rabies 

and tularemia and parasites like mange mites and ticks. 

These are just a few of the tangible positive and negative values of the furbearer resource. The 
pleasure of seeing and studying these animals is probably the greatest of the intangible values. 
When both positive and negative aspects are considered, the importance of scientifically based 

wildlife management becomes apparent. 

Wildlife	Management	Principles

Wise use of abundant natural resources includes the use of a harvestable surplus, coupled with 
the conservation of the basic resource. The goal of furbearer management is to provide the 

maximum harvestable surplus consistent with other factors such as habitat quality and

12,"species. The best available knowledge of ecology, behavior, current populations and habitat 

conditions is integrated into management plans using the principles of wildlife management. 

Generally, each wildlife population reaches its lowest level just after the breeding season, 

regardless of whether it was harvested by people or not. The remaining individuals breed and 
once again produce offspring. It is because of this ability of living things to rebound from annual 
reductions that they are often referred to as “renewable resources.” Non‐renewable resources, 

such as coal, oil, and other minerals, are present only in limited quantities. 

 Within certain limits, all of the living components of the natural resource base are renewable. 

Forage plants and wildlife are renewable. Entire communities are dynamic and renewable as 
long as their requirements for life and reproduction are met. 

Every organism has a set of required resources (food, cover, shelter, and space) which must be 

supplied by its environment. Each required resource exists in some limited amount. Any 
resource that exists in an inadequate amount is called a limiting factor, because it limits the 
population of the organism in that time and place. For example, a marsh may have enough food, 

cover, shelter, and space to  support 1,000 muskrat during the spring, summer, and fall. During 
the winter months, the food supply may only support 300 muskrat. Though the cover, shelter, 

and space are sufficient, the remaining 700 muskrat must either avoid the food shortage by 
moving elsewhere or die. 

The entire set of required resources determines the carrying capacity of a particular area for 

each species. The carrying capacity is the number of animals a habitat can support at any point 
in time. Carrying capacity is similar to the volume of a bucket. When the bucket has been filled, 

adding more to it only wastes what    is added. Sometimes the best management plan dictates 
that a population be held below its carrying capacity for some reason, such as when a species is 
causing excessive damage. Management attempts to achieve levels above the carrying capacity 

of the habitat are invitations to environmental problems and resource waste. All living     things, 
including human beings, share the limitations of carrying capacity. 


Most organisms produce more offspring than the habitat can support. The excess individuals are 
lost through predation, starvation, disease, or some other means. Loss rates are quite high in 
most organisms. Muskrats, for example, frequently lose 

70 percent of their population from one breeding season 
to the next. This attrition (loss) rate is found whether 

humans influence it or not. Increases in mortality caused 
by one factor, such as predation, are often compensated 
by decreases in other factors, such as starvation or 

disease. Thus, the total loss rate remains fairly constant. 

Wildlife cannot be stockpiled; it is a dynamic resource

population consists of two parts: breeding stock and surplus stock. Breeding stock is that portion 
of the population that the habitat can support. Surplus stock is the portion the habitat cannot 

support. Surplus  stock will die by some means before the next year’s young are produced. Use 
of the surplus provides recreation, products, food and employment without depleting the 
breeding stock. The breeding stock that remains produces another surplus and provides the 

other wildlife benefits that many consider essential. 

If the resource is to be maintained for the use and enjoyment of future generations, 
management decisions cannot be based on whim, political expediency, or emotion. In some 

instances, such as disease epidemics, good management dictates drastic reductions in 
populations. In others, such as the management of endangered species, complete protection is 

the best management plan. 

 

The	Rationale	for	Trapping

Furbearers are a part of the wildlife resource. The harvest of surplus furbearing animals results 

mainly in the production of durable, warm and beautiful fur clothing. Recent criticisms of 
trapping and the fur industry have implied vanity demands furs instead of readily available 
synthetic fibers. Beauty is only part of the usefulness of fur. One of its greatest advantages is the 

renewability of the resource and the relatively low fossil fuel cost of its production. Synthetic 
fibers come either from nonrenewable resources (coal or petroleum) or from energy intensive 

resources (wood‐fiber). Most of the energy involved in the production of fur garments is 
biological energy, the energy of growth and of human labor. As a result, fur garments have a 
lower carbon footprint then their synthetic counterparts. 


Sound furbearer management can attain the double goal of wisely using surplus stocks while 
preserving breeding stocks for future productivity and use. Harvesting wisely, legally, efficiently, 
selectively, and humanely, trappers can manage for a continued yield of furbearers, and ensure 

the resource is preserved for future generations. In that way, benefits of both consumptive and 
non‐consumptive use of the resource can be realized.  

 


Use	the	Right	Trap	for	the	Situation

Before placing the first trap, a trapper should learn all he or she can about trapping and 
furbearers. A responsible trapper uses selective sets and minimizes the time a trapped animal is 

held. Trappers have spent a great deal of time designing and improving traps and types of sets 
that will kill their catch as quickly and humanely as possible and designing restraining traps and 

systems that hold animals alive with a minimum or no injuries. Responsible trappers carefully

14,"Body‐gripping traps, which are designed to kill the trapped animal relatively quickly, do not 

always do so and are not adaptable to all types of furbearers or all types of sets. No responsible 
trapper will use a body‐gripping trap where it is possible to catch animals such as protected 

wildlife, domestic stock, or house pets.  

Box traps, including cage‐like wire traps which catch only one animal at a time, are appropriate 
and effective in some trapping situations, although not for fox or coyote. They seldom harm 

their catch and make it possible to easily release unintended catches. They are excellent choices 
for areas where domestic animals or other unintended species are frequently encountered, such 

as in urban or suburban areas when trapping problem raccoons, skunks, and opossums.  

Foothold traps (steel traps) are the primary type of trap used. Animals taken in these are 
commonly caught by the foot. When properly set and of appropriate size, the major effect of 

the trap lies with restricting the animal’s movements. Some animals resist being so restricted; 
others may lie down and even sleep. Unwanted animals can usually be released. Desired 

animals are killed by the trapper as quickly and humanely as     possible. When trapping semi‐
aquatic animals, sets are made so that the animal is quickly submerged and killed through 
asphyxiation.  


Enclosed foothold or foot‐encapsulating traps are a recent design that trappers developed to 
increase trapping selectivity. Designed primarily for trapping raccoon (although they will also 
capture skunks and opossums), these traps employ a small diameter opening and pull‐type 

trigger, making them virtually dog‐proof. The use of these species‐specific devices has allowed 
trappers to operate in areas that were previously avoided because of concerns about capturing 

domestic stock and pets. 

By law, trappers must visit their traps at least once in every 24‐hour period (48 hours in some

Regulations,	and	Ethics


 

Trapping	Laws	and	Regulations

Conservation laws are designed to ensure a continuing population of furbearers and to establish 
ethical standards for trapping. They also aid in permitting all citizens to share the common 

resource. Usually, open seasons are set to include the period when the fur is at its best or 
                                  “prime.” Both the regulations on trapping and the open season 
                                  for various species of furbearers are listed in the annual 
                                  “Hunting & Trapping Regulations Guide” and on the 

                                  Department of Environmental Conservation website at 
                                  www.dec.ny.gov. The guide booklets are available wherever 
                                  licenses are sold. Regulations and season dates sometimes 

                                  change, so trappers should review   the “Hunting & Trapping 
                                  Regulations Guide” before hitting the trap line each year. When 
                                  in doubt about some point on seasons or regulations, check 

                                  with your local Environmental Conservation Officer or call your 
                                  nearest Regional Wildlife Office and speak to a biologist 
                                  familiar with trapping.  

Key points to remember:  


            The law requires you to visit your traps at least once in every 24‐hour period (48 
            hours in some areas) and to tag all traps clearly with your name and address or your 
            license ID number. 

           You are required to carry your trapping license with you when you are trapping.  

           You must comply with all licensing and tagging regulations. 

           The law specifically prohibits disturbing lawfully placed traps or removing lawfully 
            trapped animals from the traps of another person. 

           Trappers should avoid harming domestic animals. 

Trappers must be familiar with many other laws, such as those protecting    landowners and their 
property. Securing the permission of landowners before setting traps is the trapper’s 

responsibility. Trappers must also be familiar with laws protecting certain species of wildlife, and

Trapping	Ethics

The use of a public resource demands that you exercise both courtesy and personal 
responsibility. Respect for oneself, landowners, other people, the furbearer resource, and 
habitat summarizes this expression of that courtesy and responsibility. It is delineated in a 

personal code of ethics that goes beyond legal requirements and is set      forth on the inside cover 
of this manual. It is your responsibility to adhere to this code. Remember that you may be the 
only trapper the public may come in contact with. You should act in a way that will reflect 

positively on all trappers. 

Trappers must know and obey trapping laws and be willing to report violations of these laws to 

their local Environmental Conservation Officer or to the Turn in Poachers and Polluters line at 1‐
800‐TIPP‐DEC. Failure to do so may result in increased public criticism of trapping and possible 
limitations in opportunities for all trappers.  


Responsible	Trapping
The proper use of legal traps will help deflect public criticism of trapping. Using the proper size 

and type of trap for the intended species minimizes or eliminates injuries to the trapped animal. 
Using selective sets and baits at the proper locations reduces the chances of catching unwanted 
animals. Securing a trap in a manner to hold any animal captured eliminates the possibility of 

animals escaping with the trap still attached. An empty or bent trap is better than an animal 
escaping with the trap.  

Cover all foothold traps set on land. This will actually increase your catch and reduce any 

damage caused to the animal.  

Check traps daily and as early in the day as possible to minimize the time an animal spends in 
the trap. This in turn reduces the likelihood of physical damage and stress to the captured 

animal and decreases the chance of escape. 

When trapping in the water for semi‐aquatic 
species, all traps should be placed in a manner 

that will submerge the captured animal. This 
causes a quick and humane death. Setting the 

trap in the water also reduces the likelihood of 
catching unintended animals. When trapping 
muskrats, using guarded foothold traps or small

are found in shallow or heavily vegetated water areas where there is either insufficient depth to 

submerge the animal or the trap and anchoring system may become entangled before the

Considering the activities of others, whether they are hunting, watching birds, or harvesting 
crops, is an essential part of the trapping ethic. A good trapper is a good citizen who respects 

the rights and property of others. A trapping license does not entitle the trapper to free access 
to private land. Get permission to trap on private land. Remember not to cut stakes, drive on 
farm lands or set traps in standing crops such as 

corn without specific permission from the 
landowner. A trapper can cultivate a landowner’s

Do not use exposed carcasses or parts of animals, meat, or fish as bait. These can attract raptors 
(birds of prey) and may lead to your catching one of these protected birds. Since raptors hunt by

currently required by regulation for any set made with a foothold trap. 

A good general rule for humane trapping is to always use the smallest size trap available that

18,"can be effectively trapped with traps no larger than a #1 ½ coilspring. Larger traps can cause 

greater and unnecessary damage, especially to smaller animals.  

The pan tension of some traps (e.g., some coil spring traps) is adjustable and can help you avoid 

catching smaller animals. Accessory devices are available for adding this capability to other kinds 
of traps. The ability to adjust the pan tension of a trap can be a very important factor in reducing 
unintended catches. If you are trapping for foxes and raccoons, for example, adjusting your pan 

tensions so that between 1 and 2 pounds     of force are required to depress the pan and fire the 
trap will substantially reduce the likelihood of catching birds and smaller animals.     


Trap	Hardware
Several recommendations regarding trap hardware can be made. These are not critical for traps 
used in submersion sets, but it makes sense to have all of your traps set up the same way so 

they can be used for any type set. To ensure that the trap will turn with the animal, there should 
be one swivel at the trap end and one at the stake end of the trap chain, at a minimum. Both 
swivels  should be in good working order.  


The trap chain should be as short as it can be and still allow enough freedom to make the set. 
The chain swivel should be attached to the trap as close to the center of the trap frame as 
possible rather than at the  point where the jaws pivot on a coil spring trap or at the end of the 

spring on a long spring trap. This also helps ensure that the trap can turn with the animal. For 
larger animals such as coyote, trappers may want to add shock springs into their chain systems 

to minimize the stress the animal can place on the chain. 

Finally, the addition of extra springs to traps is not recommended. This can contribute to 
excessive or unnecessary damage to the trapped animal. The mechanical advantage of the trap 

design is usually more important than the speed with which the jaws close for catching and 
holding animals. 


The use of drags is not recommended. They can cause a trapped animal to be seriously injured 
or to be lost. Every trap should be anchored firmly enough to hold any animal that could be 
caught. You do not want an animal escaping with your trap attached to it.   


Cover all foothold traps set on land with a layer of sifted dirt or other covering. This will increase 
your catch and it is required by law in some cases. Check your traps daily and as early in the day 
as possible to minimize the time an animal spends in the trap to help reduce damage, stress and 

the chance of a pullout.   

Keep	Yourself	Up	to	Date
Completion of a trapper training course does not mean that you are an accomplished trapper 

who knows all there is to know. A good trapper realizes this and is always willing to learn. New 
traps and trapping techniques are constantly being developed. Trapping organizations,

19,"conventions in New York or elsewhere is an excellent way to learn from seasoned expert 

trappers. A good trapper stays up to date with these changes in order to be as humane, 
selective, and effective as possible. Keeping yourself current is your responsibility. 


A good trapper respects the resource being used. Respect in this instance includes making full 
use of the animal once removed from the wild. Proper pelt preparation ensures that the fur will 
not be wasted. Some carcasses can be used for food, dog food, or in lure preparation. Game 

cookbooks have recipes for delicious meals from furbearers.    As long as you have the meat and it 
is properly handled, why not try dishes like “broiled marsh rabbit” (really muskrat) or beaver 

stew? When the carcass cannot be used, dispose of it in a manner which will not offend other 
people, such as burial or composting (see http://cwmi.css.cornell.edu/composting.htm       for 
information on how to compost animals). 


The trap sets and other information in this manual are presented to guide you in becoming a 
good trapper. Over the years, these sets have proven to be the most selective and humane. The 

tools of trappers are important, but the proper use of these tools is what will make you become 
a responsible trapper. You have a choice; you can support trapping and the future of the 
resource by abiding by both the law and the standards set for an ethical trapper, or you can 

ignore this information and risk harming the furbearer resource    and reducing trapping 
opportunities for all trappers. Let’s work together for the future of trapping and our valuable 

furbearing animals. 

Success	in	Trapping
Some beginning trappers think that a successful trapper catches a furbearer in almost every 
trap, every night, which just doesn’t happen. Many professional trappers average only one fox      

for each twenty traps checked. A trapper’s catch depends on many things such as the area 
trapped, weather and furbearer populations. Success results from a combination of skill, 

experience, proper equipment, thorough scouting, properly set traps and confidence in your 
equipment and methods. Trappers should not be judged by their catch volume but rather by 
how ethical and responsible they are. An important part of that responsibility is to continue

21,"Chapter	5	Trapping	Safety	and


Wildlife	Diseases


 

Trapping is not a dangerous activity, but there are risks related to weather, drowning, animal 
bites, and disease. Develop safe attitudes and make safe behavior a habit. 

Hypothermia

Hypothermia is a leading cause of death among people who enjoy outdoor recreation. Cold and 
wet weather, wind, and falls in water can lead to a loss of body heat. When your body 
temperature starts to fall, hypothermia sets in and it can happen very quickly.  

Shivering is one of the first signs of hypothermia. If this happens, go to a warm place, put on 

warm and dry clothes, or build a fire.  Soon after shivering starts, a hypothermic person may 
become confused and clumsy. Watch for signs of hypothermia whenever you are outdoors in 
cooler weather. Even when air temperatures are in the 50s, hypothermia can occur. 

Trappers can prevent hypothermia by wearing warm, layered clothing. Wool clothes are a good 

choice because wool insulates even if it becomes wet. Several modern fabrics would also be 
good choices as they can be lighter, faster drying, and waterproof. Use hip boots or waders, plus 
long‐sleeved rubber gloves when trapping in water. If you get wet, return to home, camp or 

your vehicle, and  put on dry clothes. 

Frostbite
Frostbite occurs when ice crystals form in your body’s cells. It is a common cold weather injury 
to people’s cheeks, ears, nose, toes, and fingers. Frostbite symptoms include white to grayish‐
yellow skin and an intense cold, numb feeling. Pain and blisters may also be present. Protect 

frostbitten skin from further injury. Drink warm fluids, put on more clothes, or wrap up in 
blankets. The frozen area can be soaked in warm, not hot, water (102 to 105 degrees F). Never 
rub frostbitten skin because rubbing will cause further injury. 


Trapping	on	Ice‐covered	Lakes,	Ponds,        	Rivers,	and	Streams
                                 Avoid traveling on ice‐covered streams and rivers. Water 
                                 currents can cause weak, dangerous ice. Ice on a pond or lake is 
                                 usually more consistent, but you should still be cautious. Springs, 

                                 underwater structures, and objects above the ice surface that 
                                 gather heat from the sun (for  example, logs, beaver lodges and

22,"Newly formed clear ice is generally the strongest. Some trappers consider three inches of ice to 

be the minimum thickness needed for one person to safely cross, but four inches is better. Six 
inches or more of strong ice is required for multiple people or snowmobiles. 


White ice, or ice mixed with snow and slush, is weaker than clear ice. Candle ice (deteriorating 
columnar or grainy ice), usually found in the early spring, occurs when good ice starts to 
decompose. Candle ice may be unsafe, even if it is two feet thick. Ice cleats can help you 

maintain a safe  footing. Carry a walking staff to help check for ice conditions in front of you as 
you travel. 


Many trappers carry ice safety picks while working their 
traplines. Ice safety picks have strong handles with short spikes 
in the ends. The handles are tied together with rope. Thread 

the rope  and picks through the sleeves and back of your coat 
so you will have them handy if you fall through. It is difficult to 

pull yourself out of the water without ice picks. 

If you do fall through the ice try to climb out by facing the 
direction you came from when the ice gave way. When you get out, roll in the direction you 

came from when you fell through. The ice may be even weaker if you try to go a different 
direction. 

If a companion falls through, lie down on the ice to distribute your weight. Reach out to the 

victim with a walking staff or throw them a rope. If you approach too close you may fall in too. 

After escaping from icy water build a fire immediately unless you are close to shelter or a vehicle 

where you can get warm. After falling into icy water, hypothermia will set in quickly. If you have 
a cell phone with you, call for help immediately. 

Drowning
Trappers need to be aware of the danger of drowning. It is easy to slip and fall down a steep 

bank or slip into deep water holes of rivers and streams when wading. It is difficult to swim 
when wearing waders or hip boots or when your coat pockets are filled with heavy gear. 


It is a good idea to wear an inflatable personal flotation device when trapping around water. 
Good ones have a gas canister that can be used to inflate the vest    instantly if you need it. The 
vest should also have a tube you can use to inflate it by mouth if the gas canister fails. 


When wading, it is best to travel upstream because the water depth generally increases 
gradually. You are more likely to encounter steep drop‐offs caused by currents when walking 
downstream. 


Use a walking staff when wading to probe the water depth and bottom conditions. Smooth

24,"the bite or scratch of an infected animal. Rabies can also be transmitted by contamination of a 

cut or scratch when skinning an infected animal, or from contact with your eyes, nose, or 
mouth. 


Rabies occurs in two forms in wildlife; “dumb” and “furious”. In the dumb form the animal is 
lethargic and may suffer paralysis. In the furious form the animal is restless, aggressive, and may 
bite at real or imaginary objects.  


If you are bitten by a wild animal wash the bite with soap and water, then seek medical 
attention. If possible, capture or kill the animal without damaging the head. Health authorities 

will test the brain tissue for rabies. Keep the animal refrigerated at 35 to 40 degrees F until it can 
be examined. Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV) can offer protection from the rabies virus 
without serious side effects. Ask your doctor for advice about HDCV,    especially if you are 

trapping in areas where animals are known to carry rabies. 

West Nile Virus ‐ Most people who are infected with the West Nile virus will not have any type 
of symptoms. About 20% of people who become infected will develop West Nile fever. 

Symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness, and body aches. There may be a skin rash on the 
trunk of the body and swollen lymph glands. 


The symptoms of severe infection (West Nile encephalitis or meningitis) include headache, high 
fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, and 
paralysis. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 150 persons infected with the West Nile virus 

will develop a more severe form of disease. The incubation period is 3 to 14 days, and most 
West Nile fever symptoms last for a few days. Severe infection symptoms may last several 

weeks. Neurological symptoms or damage may be permanent. 

It is best to prevent the West Nile virus by avoiding mosquito bites. Stay out of the field from 
dusk to dawn during mosquito season. Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, and socks when 

outdoors. Use a mosquito repellant containing DEET on exposed skin. The Center for Disease 
Control advises that  you should not use DEET repellant on skin under your clothes. Do not apply 

repellants containing permethrin directly to your skin. 

Tularemia ‐ Tularemia is a bacterial disease most commonly associated with rabbits and hares. 
Beavers and muskrats may also carry this disease.  


Tularemia is most commonly transmitted by the bite of blood sucking ticks or fleas. The bacteria 
enter the body, multiply, and invade internal organs. The liver and spleen enlarge and become 
covered with white spots. Humans can get tularemia from skinning infected animals, drinking 

contaminated water, being bitten by infected deer flies and ticks, and sometimes by eating 
undercooked meat. Symptoms include fever, infected sores, swollen lymph nodes and flu‐like 

feelings. These symptoms may become severe. With prompt antibiotic treatment, few cases of

25,"Lyme Disease ‐ Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread by the bite of a deer tick (Ixodes 

dammini). When diagnosed early the disease can be treated with antibiotics.  

People get Lyme disease when they are bitten by ticks carrying Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. 

Ticks that carry Lyme disease are very small and can be hard to see. If these tiny ticks bite mice 
infected with Lyme disease and then bite people or other animals the disease can be passed on. 
After several days or weeks the bacteria may spread throughout the body of an infected person. 


Diagnosis is difficult nce Lyme disease symptoms vary and are similar to other common 
illnesses. One of the first symptoms may be a red circular skin lesion, but often the rash will not 

appear. Other early symptoms are flu‐like and may include weakness, headaches, nausea, fever, 
stiff neck, dizziness, muscle aches, sore throat, and swollen glands. In advanced stages more 
serious symptoms may occur including facial paralysis, arthritis, and heart problems. Consult 

your physician if you have symptoms of Lyme disease. 

Prevent Lyme disease by preventing tick bites. Use a repellant containing DEET on exposed skin. 
The Center for Disease Control advises that you should not use DEET repellant on skin under 

your clothes. Do not apply repellants containing permethrin directly to your skin. Wear light 
colored clothing when walking in tick habitat. Wear long sleeves and long pants. Check yourself 

thoroughly for ticks. If bitten by a tick remove it promptly and disinfect the bite with rubbing 
alcohol.  

Leptospirosis ‐ Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that infects humans and animals.  Almost all 

mammals can be infected, but it is more common in domestic animals than wildlife. The disease 
is known to infect striped skunks, raccoons, foxes, opossums, bobcats, muskrats and 

woodchucks. Leptospirosis spreads from     eating infected food, contact with the urine of an 
infected animal, or contact with urine‐contaminated water. The bacteria may enter the body 
through skin wounds, mucous membranes, or cuts. Leptospirosis bacteria multiply in the blood 

stream and may affect the kidneys.  The bacteria leaves the body in the urine.    Infection can 
cause flu‐like symptoms in humans including headache, fever, muscle ache, vomiting, and 

kidney damage. Antibiotics are very effective for treatment. 

Sarcoptic Mange ‐ Mange is caused by a parasitic mite. It occurs throughout North America and 
is most commonly found among red fox, coyotes, and domestic dogs. Adult female mites 

burrow under the skin and deposit their eggs. This causes the animal to scratch, chew, or lick the 
infected area, which leads to inflammation and infection. When the eggs hatch the condition 

worsens. The animal’s hair falls out. The skin thickens, and gets crusted with scabs, and cracks. 
Mange   is always fatal to red foxes and sometimes to coyotes. The mite is transmitted among 
animals through direct contact or by contact with contaminated areas such as dens or burrows.

26,"Trichinosis ‐ Trichinosis is caused by eating raw or undercooked pork and wild game infected 

with a roundworm parasite called trichinella. It affects people and many kinds of domestic and 
wild animals. The parasite forms cysts in muscle tissue. 


Cook furbearer meat thoroughly until the juices run clear. Freezing game meat, even for long 
periods, may not kill all worms. Likewise, curing (salting), drying, smoking, or microwaving meat 
does not consistently kill infective worms. 


Giardiasis ‐ Giardiasis is caused by a parasite that can be carried by many animals, including 
beaver. Beaver do not appear to be severely affected by the     disease, but infected beavers can 

contaminate water sources used by people. Giardiasis spreads from drinking contaminated 
water or eating contaminated food. Human symptoms include diarrhea, cramping, weakness, 
and mild fever. The condition can last 1‐2 weeks. Medication is usually prescribed to treat this 

ailment. 

Raccoon Roundworms ‐ Baylisascaris procyonis is     a common intestinal roundworm parasite 
found in raccoons and can cause a fatal nervous system disease in wild animals. The worms 

develop to maturity in the raccoon intestine, where they produce millions of eggs that are 
passed on with the feces. Released eggs take 2‐4 weeks to become infective to other animals 

and humans. The    eggs can survive for years.  Most raccoons in New York, especially young of the 
year, have raccoon roundworm infections. 

Raccoons tend to defecate in specific places over a period of time. Likely places are at the base 

of trees, barn lofts, sand boxes, chimneys, attics, or on high surfaces such as rocks or roofs. 
People become infected when they accidentally ingest the eggs. The eggs can become airborne 

as dust particles and people can inhale them. When humans eat or inhale raccoon roundworm 
eggs, they hatch into larvae in the person’s intestine and travel through the body, affecting the 
organs and   muscles. Severity depends on how many eggs are ingested and where in the body 

the larvae spread. Symptoms can include nausea, tiredness, loss of coordination, and blindness. 
Infected animals may shows signs similar to rabies. 


Tapeworms and Other Parasites ‐ People can get tapeworms and other parasites from contact 
with furbearer or dog feces. Keep your hands clean to prevent accidental ingestion of the 
microscopic eggs.  Echinococcus granulosus has been confirmed in New York and its eggs may be 

found on the fur and in the feces of coyotes.  Trappers should wear gloves when handling 
coyotes and wash their hands thoroughly     after handling coyotes or their pelts. 

Other Viral Diseases ‐ Pseudorabies, parvovirus, and distemper are diseases that can be carried 

by furbearers and passed on to pets or livestock. Have your pets vaccinated and seek treatment

27,"Trappers desiring additional information on animal diseases and parasites should speak to their 

physician or search the New York State Department of Health website at 
www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/.   


Animal	Bites	and	Scratches
Animal bites and scratches can cause serious injuries. Wash wounds thoroughly with soap and 
water, apply bandages, and seek medical assistance. Keep the animal confined for observation if 

possible. If you can’t confine the animal, kill it without damaging the head so that health 
authorities can test it for rabies.  If bitten, report the incident immediately to your local County 
Health Department. 


See the chapter on “Running a Trapline” for information on safe ways to release animals from 
traps to prevent bites and scratches. 

Be	Safe,	Be	Seen

Trapping seasons usually coincide with hunting seasons for several species of game animals.  
Trappers should make themselves visible to hunters by wearing hunter orange, or another 
highly visible color, article of clothing. Something as simple as a hunter orange vest or cap will 

suffice and greatly reduce the chance that a hunter may misidentify the trapper as a game 
animal.  Wearing hunter orange clothing will also make it easier to find you if you are lost, 

injured, or sick. 

Setting	Large	Body‐Gripping	Traps
Some traps, such as large body‐gripping traps used for beaver, can be dangerous to a trapper 

who doesn’t know how to use them properly. If you are accidentally caught in a large trap you 
need to know how to release yourself, which may be difficult if you can’t use one of your arms. 
Large body‐gripping traps are most often set underwater. You can drown or die from 

hypothermia if you get caught in a large   trap set underwater. 

When using large body‐gripping traps carry setting tongs and a length of rope with a loop in the 
end at all times. Keep the rope in a pocket or around your waist where you can easily reach it 

with either hand. If you are caught, thread the rope through the ends of the springs. Put your 
foot in the loop and use your free arm to pull the loose end. This releases the pressure on the 

springs so you can free yourself. 

Firearms	Safety
Many trappers carry firearms to shoot animals caught in traps. Take a hunter     education course 

to learn about firearm safety. Practice safe habits around firearms at all times. 

When trapping it is generally a good idea to keep your firearm unloaded until you need to use it. 
It can be difficult to maintain control of a firearm when you are carrying gear and making sets.

28,"When you shoot at an animal in a trap, be especially careful about ricochets off the trap or other 

hard surfaces such as rocks or hard soils. Ricochets may also occur off from water. If you are 
trapping with companions, everyone should stand behind the shooter. 


Always look beyond your target when shooting a firearm and only shoot if it is safe. Keep the 
muzzle under control and pointed in a safe direction at all times, even when the gun is not 
loaded. 


Getting	Lost
It is easy to get lost if you are in unfamiliar territory. When you are looking for sign and places to 
make sets you may not be paying close attention to landmarks and trails. Always carry a map of 

the place you are trapping and a compass. Many people carry a global positioning system (GPS) 
unit. If you carry a GPS, make certain you know how to use it and carry extra batteries but still 

carry a compass for a backup in case your GPS is not functioning.  You can also use a GPS to 
mark the locations of your trap making them easier to relocate in areas unfamiliar to you. 

Additional	Safety	Tips
Although many    people trap alone it is best to use the buddy system for any outdoor activity. 

That way if you are injured or sick your buddy can assist you or go for help. 

Always tell your family exactly where you are going and when you plan to return. If you change 

locations or plans, let your family know. Leave a map of your trapline at home. 

Wireless or cell phones are a good safety tool for trappers. Do not rely on the phone to get you 
out of all situations though. You could be out of range or find yourself with a dead battery when 

you need your phone the most. 

A trapper must know how to start a fire. Carry waterproof matches and fire starting materials 
with you at all times. If you find yourself in a hypothermia situation it may be difficult to start a

29,"Chapter	6	Equipment	and	Preparation



 

What do you need to learn and do before you go trapping? You will need to learn trapping laws 
and regulations and obtain traps and other equipment. You must prepare the traps, make or 
purchase baits and lures, and study the furbearers you plan to catch. Before trapping season 

arrives, a wise trapper will practice making different kinds of sets and will thoroughly scout the 
area he or she plans to trap. Careful and complete preparation will increase both your 

enjoyment of trapping and your chances of success.  

 

Trapping	Equipment

The right equipment is essential to trapping success. In trapping, as in so many other activities, 
quality equipment is the best investment in the long run. By being prepared for the most wary 

and difficult‐to‐trap animals, the trapper can take advantage of all trapping opportunities. The 
following is a list of the contents of a typical fox trapper’s pack basket: traps, gloves, pan covers, 

dirt sifter, stakes, bait jar, digging tool, lure, hatchet, kneeling pad, wire, urine, pliers, swivels, 
and extra trap tags.  As you gain experience over time, you may find that you can get by with 
fewer  items than those listed above. On the other hand, you may develop your own list of 

“essential” equipment that includes many additional items beyond this basic list. 

Carrying	Your	Equipment
The trapper must have something in which to carry all the 
equipment needed. If you trap primarily on foot, a pack 

basket is the best approach for carrying your equipment. 
Many trappers use a woven wood or fiberglass pack basket 
rather than a canvas pack because the basket is more rigid 

and more convenient to use as well as less likely to hold 
odors. Lure and bait are usually carried in a separate pouch 
or in a coat pocket to avoid contaminating traps with their 

odors.  

If you trap from a vehicle, boat, or canoe, several other 
types of containers may be better options. Plastic buckets, 

milk crates, and totes are particularly useful for trappers who do little walking while running 
their traplines. These containers can also be used for transporting any animals that are caught

30,"Gloves

If you make only dry‐land sets, a 
pair of clean, odor‐free cotton 
gloves may be sufficient. Many 

trappers prefer rubberized gloves 
to reduce human scent at the set. 

Either the short rubber gloves or 
arm‐length gauntlets are very 
useful to water trappers. They 

will more than pay for themselves 
in comfort and preventing 

chapped skin or frost bite. Keep gloves clean, and keep bait, lure, or other odors off the gloves. 
Some trappers carry an additional pair of heavy gloves solely for handling animals. 

Digging	Tool

Many sets call for a bit of digging. Most trappers  use 
some type of long, sturdy trowel. Special trapping 
trowels are available, but other options include a tile 

spade, small folding shovel, garden trowel, or large 
spoon. Modified hammers with digging blades welded 

on are also available and good options in areas with 
compact or rocky soils. Buy the best   one you can 
afford as it will see frequent use. 


Dirt	Sifter
A dirt sifter is simply a mesh‐bottomed box. Most 
trappers make their own using a wooden frame about 

8"" x 10” x 3"" and tacking in a bottom of 1/4"" 
hardware cloth. A sifter is extremely useful in dirt or 

snow trapping. Covering the trap is required in most 
cases and reduces the likelihood of damaging trapped 
animals, and sifting the covering material helps to 

prevent stones or twigs from jamming the trap.  
Several commercial models of sifters are available. 

Traps

You will need traps of the right size and type for the species you wish to target. Traps with teeth 
are illegal to use in New York State. By law, all your traps must be clearly marked or tagged with 
your name and address or your license ID number. Appendix 1 lists appropriate trap sizes, set 

types, and  effective baits and lures for each furbearer species found in New York.  

Long‐spring traps have the longest history of design as steel traps but because they contain

31,"situations where traps can be easily concealed and the 

extra weight might be an asset (such as in submersion 
sets for beaver, otter, mink, and muskrat). 


Guarded traps (also referred to as “stoploss” traps) are 
available in several styles from several manufacturers. 
They employ an additional spring‐loaded jaw     or bail 

that helps prevent muskrat or mink from escaping. 
Many muskrat trappers use these types of traps almost 

exclusively. 

Under‐spring or jump traps are no longer 
manufactured  but are frequently found on the used 
trap market. They are more compact and therefore 

easier to conceal than long‐spring traps.  While they are 
a little more difficult to set than long‐spring traps, 
jump traps are a bit faster closing. They are also 
significantly lighter in weight than long‐spring traps. 
Some manufacturers produced double as well as single 

under‐spring traps. 

Coil‐spring traps operate the fastest of the foothold 
traps. Available in many sizes from a variety of 

manufacturers, coil springs are often used in trapping 
predators. They have all the advantages of under‐
spring traps with the addition of increased speed and 

holding power. 

Padded coil‐spring traps have rubber pads on the jaws. 

These are another tool which can be used when 
situations warrant, such as when chances of 
encountering free‐roaming domestic animals are high. 


Foot encapsulating traps (shown on page 26) are 
designed specifically for the capture of raccoon. They 

are designed to fully enclose the trapped paw of the 
raccoon to prevent self‐inflicted damage. These traps 
have a restricted opening to minimize the capture of 

unintended animals. Some operate with a pull‐type trigger to further increase selectivity. Foot 
encapsulating traps are set with bait or lure inside the trap such that a raccoon will attempt to 

reach in the entry hole to grab  the bait, firing the trap. These traps are more expensive than 
traditional steel traps but most are simple to use and very efficient at capturing the intended

32,"Body‐gripping traps are the result of many years of research and design. They are designed to 

catch an animal around the neck or chest or both. When properly set, these traps usually kill the 
trapped animal quickly. If a chest hold occurs, the animal is killed by asphyxiation, with death 

coming quite rapidly.  

Body‐gripping traps are very popular with water trappers and 
are quite useful in some kinds of land sets. CAUTION: BODY‐

GRIPPING TRAPS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PLACES OR IN WAYS 
THAT MAY TAKE UNINTENDED ANIMALS. Body‐gripping traps 

are not adaptable to all types of furbearers, such as canines, or 
to a full range of sets. Larger body‐gripping traps (more than 7 ½ 
inches) are illegal to use on land. Medium‐sized body‐gripping 

traps set on land must adhere to special use requirements set by 
regulation. Review the trapping regulations thoroughly before 

using any body‐gripping traps. 

Box or cage traps of various kinds are useful in trapping some 
species in situations where the risk of taking domestic animals is 

high, such as when trapping nuisance wildlife around farms or 
homes, because unintended captures can be released 

unharmed. Like body‐gripping traps, however,      their use is 
limited, especially for foxes and coyotes, which avoid them. The 
cost and size of box traps are also disadvantages on trap lines. 


Cable restraints or traps (also referred to as snares) are illegal to use in New York, even though 
they may be available for sale. 

Pliers	 and	Cable	Cutters

Trappers frequently use lengths of wire or cable in making sets. 
A pair of pliers is very useful in cutting and twisting wire. They 
may also be used for field repair of equipment and in adjusting 

trap triggers. The pliers should have a cutting edge and should

Wire	and	Cable
Wire and/or cable have many uses on the trap line. Wire and cable can be used to repair chains, 
make submersion sets, or attach traps to stakes. They also are used    to hold traps, baits, or even 

cubby pens in place. Many trappers prefer a dark wire for these purposes. Strong 16‐gauge wire 
is recommended for muskrat and 11‐gauge wire or cable for larger furbearers. CAUTION: 

Beware of kinks or nicks because they will weaken the wire or cable. Do     not use wire to extend 
trap chains; instead, use additional chain or cable. 

Swivels
A swivel connecting the trap to the chain allows the trap to turn freely on the chain. This keeps 

the chain from binding and prevents undue stress or leg damage to trapped animals. In general, 
the more swivels, the better. Swivels can be rendered ineffective when tangled in vegetation or 

clogged with mud, so having more than one in your anchoring system will increase the odds that 
your trap will continue to turn freely after a catch. A good minimum is three; one at the trap end 

of the chain, one at the stake end, and one in the middle. Swivels placed close to the trap have 
the best chance of continuing to operate and allowing the trap to rotate if the chain becomes 
wrapped around an object.  


















Trap	Tags
Trap tags must be durable and easy to read. They must be firmly attached to the trap so they 

will not come off. In New York, every trap must have a tag that legibly bears the name and 
address or the license ID number of the trapper. 


Shock	springs
A shock spring can be added to the chain of restraining traps to improve the holding ability of 
the trap and improve animal welfare.  Shock springs can either be in‐line or off set with the 

chain to provide cushioning when the animal reaches the end of the trap chain.  These are most

34,"Hatchet

Every trapper needs a good hatchet on 
the trap line. Staples or stakes must be 
driven, and ice sometimes must be 

chopped in making or checking sets. 
Learn how to sharpen your hatchet and 

use it safely. Carry hatchets with the 
sharp edge covered. 

Kneeling	Pad

Some trappers use a square of cloth, rubber or plastic as an odor barrier to kneel on when 
making dirt‐hole sets. Others make these sets from a squatting position, letting only their clean, 
rubber footwear touch the ground. New trappers should try each way to see which they prefer. 


Pan	Covers
These items of wax paper, canvas, or other material are used by some trappers to prevent 
materials from getting under the pan of the trap. Other trappers consider them unnecessary and 

point out that they may carry human odors. Beginning trappers should determine the need for 
them by trying both techniques. 

Catchpole

Many trappers carry a catchpole—a pole or length of tubing 
with a rope or cable attached. This highly recommended tool 
can be used to control a trapped animal so it can be released 

or dispatched more safely and easily. A catchpole can be 
made by running a loop of plastic ‐coated cable through a 

three‐ to four‐foot piece of rigid aluminum pipe or conduit. 
Attaching one end of the cable to the pipe makes use easier. High‐quality catch poles used in the 
nuisance wildlife trapping industry may also be purchased. 


Another alternative to using a catch pole is to use a large piece of plywood with a v‐notch cut 
into the bottom. Attaching a handle to the trapper side of the plywood will make it much easier 

to use. To release an animal, the trapper places the board between himself and the animal and 
slowly approaches the trap. Once the trap is reached, the v‐notch is placed over the animal’s 
foot that is being held by the trap, allowing the trapper to open the trap jaws and release the 

animal while being protected by the board. This is the preferred method for releasing bobcats

35,"Trap	Setter

Larger body‐gripping and foothold traps often require 
considerable effort to set. Some trappers carry a trap setter 
(levers attached like scissors) to help handle these powerful 

traps. Large body‐gripping traps may also be set by using a 
length of strong small‐diameter rope with a loop on one end. 

The trapper’s foot is placed in the loop. The free end is then fed 
through the “eyes” of the trap springs twice. By pulling up on 
the free end, the trapper can compress the spring and engage 

the safety latch. 

Safety	Gripper
Whenever setting large body‐gripping traps, the trapper should 

use a safety gripper tool. Several types are available but all 
perform the same function of keeping the trap jaws from fully 
closing should the trap fire during setting. 

Anchoring	Devices
Trap stakes for dry land sets can be hardwood, metal, or–more 

recently–earth anchors. The stake must be adequate to hold 
the largest animal the trap may catch. Under most conditions, 

stakes should be about 12 to 18 inches in length. In sandy soils, 
even longer stakes are needed. In very loose soils, or when 
trapping animal like coyotes that push anchoring systems to 

their limits, itay be necessary to use two metal or wood 
stakes driven into the ground at such an angle that they form an 

X. This method is known as cross‐staking and trappers can 
purchase commercially available swivels for this purpose or 
make their own. Metal stakes should be treated to    remove 

foreign odors in the same manner as the traps themselves. The 
trap chain should be attached to the stake so it swivels on the 

stake. Be sure the trap and chain swivels are functioning properly because swivels protect 
trapped animals from unnecessary injury.  

Stakes can also be used to anchor traps set in water for 

muskrats and other animals associated with water. As always, 
stakes must be large enough to hold any animal which might be 

captured. Do not use fresh willow or other branches as stakes. 
Willow sticks can take root and clog waterways, and recently cut 
pieces of any tree or brush may be chewed by beavers, 

rendering your stakes useless. If you do cut your own stakes 
from trees or brush, cut them well in advance of the season so

36,"attractive to any beavers in the area. Wood lath, which can be purchased at most hardware 

stores, is a handy way for muskrat trappers to stake small body‐grip traps.  

Drags
Where stakes are not practical or desirable, as in very rocky soils, drags are sometimes used; 

however you should avoid using drags whenever possible because animals can escape and take 
your traps with them. Good sign reading and tracking skills are important when using drags as 

you’ll have to locate the animal after making a catch. Drags must be large enough to keep the 
animal from escaping with the    trap. Some trappers use metal drags resembling 2‐ or 3‐pronged 
hooks. A few trappers use a heavy section of seasoned hardwood. A wood drag about 4 feet 

long and at least 3 inches in diameter is usually adequate for raccoon trapping. When drags are 
used, extended chains at least  6 feet long connect the trap and drag. In general, the longer the 

chain used, the quicker the animal will become entangled and therefore be easier to find. 

Bait,	Lure,	and	Urine
Bait and lures are used to attract animals to the set.  Baits, 

lures, and urines are used in various combinations according to 
each trapper’s individual preference. With experience, each 
trapper develops techniques that work best for him or her.  


Lures and baits are used to draw the animal into the area and 
to get the animal to work (explore) the set, thus stepping into 
the trap. The odors of baits and lures should be kept off the 

traps themselves because lure‐ contaminated traps may cause 
some furbearers, like foxes, to dig the traps out of the set. Baits 

and lures should be carried outside the pack basket to prevent 
trap contamination. 

Bait and lure combinations abound. Most trapping books 

contain information on lure preparation, and many trappers 
prepare their own baits and lures. Only experimentation will 

tell which baits and lures are best for a particular set. 
Experienced trappers are always trying new things. Beginning 
trappers would be wise to use commercial lures until they 

develop their own. A new   bait or lure should be used on only a 
few sets until it has proven successful. 

Responsible trappers try to use the most selective baits and lures possible. Some trappers use 

animal urine as an attractant and suspicion remover when trapping fox, coyote, or bobcat. In 
general, gland lures and urines are very selective furbearer attractants. Never use cat or dog 

food for bait. Never use exposed carcasses as bait, as they may attract birds of prey.  Cover all

are trapping to help determine the best bait and lures. 

 


Trapping	Equipment	Preparation

All equipment used in land trapping should be clean and free of foreign odors. When traps come 
from the manufacturer, they are coated with oil. Before they can be treated, the oil must be 
removed, which can be accomplished by washing in detergent or boiling in wood ashes or 

caustic soda  solution. Traps can also be soaked in a solution of vinegar and water for a few days 
to remove the oil coating. After one of these cleaning processes, leave new traps outside to get 
a light coating of rust, which will help whatever treatment is used to adhere to the metal 


All traps should be checked and adjusted so that the pans sit level when set. Make sure each 
trap has a readable tag as required by law. Remove all sharp edges and burrs. Check chains, 

stakes, and drags for weak spots before treating and after each catch. Replace worn or broken 
parts immediately. 

The traps, chains, drags, and stakes, along with any other metal or equipment, can now be 

treated. Place a small piece of wood or wire between the jaws of the traps to hold them open 
during treatment. 

Many coloring or dyeing agents are used for treating traps. Logwood powder or chips, sumac 

berries, walnut hulls, hemlock bark, and maple bark are some of the commonly used agents. A 
strong, hot solution of the material is kept at a simmer, and the traps are left in it until they 
become black. This dye coat prevents or slows rusting, makes     the trap easier to conceal, and 

helps remove undesired odors. New traps are much more difficult to dye than traps that already 
have a dye coat or a fine film of rust. 

Traps that are to be used in land sets are often waxed to prevent further rust. You can buy trap 

wax or make it with paraffin mixed with a small amount of beeswax and a pea‐sized piece of 
pine resin. Some trappers coat the traps with a thin wax film by carefully placing hot, dry traps in 

a smoking hot wax solution. The objective is to coat all  parts of the trap with a very thin layer of 
wax. USE EXTREME CAUTION! The wax is flammable.  Traps should only be waxed outdoors and 
away from buildings. Keep fire control devices such as a garbage can cover nearby to smother 

any fires.  Having a fire extinguisher on hand is  very good idea.  

Do not wax body‐gripping traps. Waxed body‐gripping traps become very difficult to set, 
frequently springing unexpectedly. They cannot be depended on to stay set, and they may be

38,"After being dyed and waxed, hang the traps in the open air away from foreign odors, handling 

them only with clean gloves. Traps that pick up foreign odors or food odors should be re‐treated 
before being used again for land sets.   


Some trappers use commercial dips to treat their traps. These dyes are mixed with lantern fuel, 
gasoline, or even water depending on the type. Be extra cautious and stay clear of any possible 
ignition sources. Once mixed, the trapper simply dips the cleaned traps and hardware into the 

solution and hangs them up to dry. This results in   a hard, durable finish on the metal. At first, 
the finish will be shiny but it will become dull with time and use. To get the best finish, trappers 

should dip their traps only on warm, sunny days with low humidity. Humid conditions may cause 
the finish to feel sticky. ter dipping body‐grip traps, particularly those to be used in water, you 
may wish to remove the dip from parts of the trigger assembly because the dipped finish can 

cause the trap to become difficult to set, much the same as when waxed. Use sandpaper or a 
small file toremove the finish from those areas.  


Another alternative to dipping or dyeing and waxing your traps is to paint them with a coat of 
flat or matte spray paint. Be sure the trap is cleaned first and allowed to fully dry. Some trappers 
even use multiple paint colors to create a camouflage effect on their body‐grip traps to better 

conceal them from furbearers and trap thieves alike. This popular treatment is done less often 
with foothold traps intended for use in land trapping. 

Every effort should be made not to contaminate the traps with lure, bait, human scent, smoke, 

or blood from previously trapped animals. Similar precautions should be used with all the other 
items that are left at a set and tools that are used at the set (e.g. trowel, pliers). Clean traps 

won’t help if there are odors on a stake or chain which give the set away. 

Metal box traps may be treated like other traps, but wooden box traps should be permitted to

39,"Chapter	7	Best	Management	Practices



 

Trapping “best management practices,” or BMPs, are actions, equipment, and techniques that 
improve animal welfare, help avoid the unintended capture of other animals, and increase 
public support for trapping.  


DEC strongly encourages trappers to use trapping BMPs at all 
times because these will help sustain regulated trapping as a 
wildlife management tool and maintain the integrity of wildlife 

conservation programs throughout the United States. Trapping 
BMPs are based on the most extensive research effort of 
animal traps ever conducted in the United States, including 

research conducted in New York. Traps tested were selected 
based on knowledge of commonly used traps, previous 
research, and input from expert trappers. 


Where	to	find	detailed	BMP	information	for	each	furbearer
Trappers can find all current information on trapping BMPs at the following web site: 

http://jjcdev.com/~fishwild/?section=best_management_practices  

On this site, trappers can find summary BMP documents for all species of furbearers found in 

New York. 

The Furbearer Management web site is maintained by the Association of Fish and Wildlife 
Agencies (AFWA) on behalf of state fish and wildlife agencies, trappers, and trapping 
organizations. 


Background	information
In 1996, the then International Association of Fish and Wildlife 
Agencies (this organization is now known as the Association of 

Fish and Wildlife Agencies) began a program to develop Best 
Management Practices (BMPs) for trapping as a way to improve 
the welfare of captured animals and to document 

improvements in trapping technology. This   project is one of the 
most ambitious in the history of the conservation movement. 

AFWA coordinates the development of BMPs for trapping. 
AFWA’s membership includes all 50 state fish and wildlife

40,"York have been heavily involved in this effort via a multi‐state committee of fish and wildlife 

agency biologists. 

State furbearer biologists, veterinarians, trappers, and scientists from the University of Georgia 

and the University of Wyoming cooperated on the development of BMPs. The United States 
Department of Agriculture provided most of the funding for trapping BMP research and 
development. 


BMPs are based on the most extensive research effort of animal traps ever conducted in the 
United States. Traps tested were selected based on knowledge of commonly used traps, 

previous research, and input from expert trappers. 

Trapping BMPs were developed to      give wildlife professionals information they need to improve 
animal welfare. State fish and wildlife agencies will use BMPs to continue the improvement of 

trapping systems throughout the United States.  

Trapping BMPs include suggestions on practices, equipment, and techniques that will provide 
trappers and wildlife biologists with practical information to use in the field.  


BMP	Evaluation	Criteria
BMP traps were evaluated using criteria to measure the effects on animal welfare as well as 
trapping efficiency, selectivity, practicality, and safety. 


Animal Welfare ‐ Researchers used live restraining traps to test for injuries to furbearers using 
two methods. One system evaluated specific injuries, and the other grouped the injuries into 
categories from mild to severe. BMP‐approved traps must have a low rate of injuries to the 

furbearing animals being studied. Recommended traps resulted in moderate, low, or no injury 
to at least 70% of the animals trapped. 


Efficiency ‐ Traps meeting BMP criteria must be able to capture and hold at least 60% of the 
furbearers that spring the trap. 

Selectivity ‐ Traps must be set and used in a fashion that limits the risk of capturing non‐

furbearing species while increasing the chances of capturing the desired furbearer. 

Practicality ‐ Each recommended live restraining trap was evaluated by experienced trappers 
and wildlife biologists for practicality. Criteria used to measure practicality include cost, ease of 

use, ease of transport, storage, weight and size, reliability, versatility, and the expected life‐span 
of the trap. 

Safety ‐ Each recommended live restraining trap was evaluated for safety to the user and other

41,"BMP	Results
While BMPs do not specifically recommend which brand of trap should be used (though they do 
note the particular brand that was tested and passed the criteria listed above), they do list 

specifications of those traps that performed the best. For example, for coyote (eastern United 
States), coilspring traps with plain jaws and a 5 to 5 ½ inch jawspread performed best. The 
              TM
Woodstream        Victor No. 1.75 and No. 2 traps were tested for this category. 

See http://jjcdev.com/~fishwild/?section=best_management_practices for the full set of BMP 

publications, including detailed listings of all traps that passed the rigorous BMP research

43,"Chapter	8	Selective	Trapping


Techniques


 

Selective trapping is a challenging activity. Each time you set a trap, you should make the set to 
catch a specific furbearer or small group of furbearers (i.e. mink and muskrat, beaver and otter, 

fisher and raccoon). You should also take steps to prevent catching pets or other unintended 
animals. The information in this chapter will give you an introduction to selective trapping 
techniques in preparation for understanding the chapters on making sets. 


Location,	Location,	Location
The location of your set is the first 
consideration for selective trapping. Each 
species of furbearer lives in a certain kind 

of habitat, eats certain kinds of food, and 
follows certain habits. Use this knowledge 
to find the best places to set your traps. 

Pre‐season scouting will reveal which 
locations are best for your intended 
furbearer. However, abundant sign of the desired animal is not the only determining factor in 

whether or not you have found a good location for a set. Other factors must be considered: 

            Is the location near a trail that is heavily used by people nd their pets?  

            Do hunters using dogs use the same area? 

            If you catch an animal, will it be visible to people passing by? 

You should be able to answer “no” to each of these questions. If you answered “yes” to any of 
these questions, do not set traps  in this location.  

Once a suitable location has been found, there are several additional techniques that can be 

employed to increase the selectivity of your set. For example: 

            If you make a muskrat set at the edge of a stream, you can avoid trapping ducks and 
             other water birds by sticking branches out of the stream bank above the trap. 
             Muskrats can pass below the branches, but ducks will be hesitant to do so.  

            You can make a cubby for raccoons that will keep most dogs from springing the trap

The proper use of bait, lure, and urine is a key factor in selective trapping. Each furbearing 
animal responds to certain food smells. Glandular lures can appeal to a specific animal’s 
curiosity or territorial urges. Never use pet food for bait. Avoid other baits that might attract 

dogs or cats. For example, fish might attract cats if you are trapping near homes that have pets. 
For some species like raccoon, consider using sweet baits (baits that use fruit as a base) instead 

of meat or fish to minimize the chances of attracting dogs or cats. While the use of selective 
attractants will minimize the chances of unintended catches, they are not foolproof. Therefore, 
the trapper must continue to employ all other techniques to avoid catching domestic and other 

unintended animals.  

If large baits such as animal carcasses are used, be sure to cover them so that they are not 

visible from above. This will protect against the accidental capture of birds of prey, which hunt 
by sight. The scent coming from the covered bait makes your set attractive to many furbearers 
that forage primarily through their sense of smell. 


You’ve	got	the	location,	now	what?
Choosing the proper size and type of trap for the situation and species being sought is also a key 
component of trapping selectively. The size of the jaw spread and strength of the spring can 

help catch and hold a specific furbearer. Pan tension is an important consideration as well. Try 
two pounds for fox   or bobcats and four pounds for coyotes. Trigger length and placement in 

body‐grip traps can help you to target certain furbearers like beaver, while avoiding the capture 
of others like otter or muskrat. 

Trappers can use the BMPs developed by AFWA to aid in the selection of the proper traps for 

various furbearer species. Recall from Chapter 7 that two criteria of the BMP trap testing 
process were selectivity and efficiency. The BMP trap‐testing process has saved today’s trappers 
a lot of trial and error by scientifically evaluating many of the traps available today and 

highlighting which trap types  and specifications are best for a particular species. BMPs can be 
found on the AFWA website at: 

http://jjcdev.com/~fishwild/?section=best_management_practices. 

Trap placement is another factor in selective trapping. At a dirt‐hole set, for example, try placing 
the trap so the pan is closer to the bait hole for fox and farther away for larger coyotes. Give 

thought to the physical characteristics and habits of the animal you are trying to catch and let

Responsible trappers make every effort to learn all they can about the 
property they trap and who might be using the property for other 
activities. Find out who else has permission to be on the property and 

when they will be there. This will help you avoid problems, and you 
may make some new friends in the process. Try to talk to the other 

users of the property so you can work out a plan that will allow 
everyone to use the property to your enjoyment while avoiding 
potential conflicts. 


Public areas provide millions of acres  of land and water where trapping is permitted. During 
times of heavy public use for upland bird hunting, it is a good idea to focus on water trapping to 

avoid the possibility of catching dogs. Since most furbearers are nocturnal, you can make sets in 
the evening and pull them   or trip them the next morning. Local wildlife biologists, rangers, or 
conservation officers can tell you about the most heavily used hunting areas so that you can 

avoid them when hunters are running dogs. 

These are just a few examples of the ways you can make your sets more selective and        avoid 

unintended catches. To learn more, study BMP documents and the natural history of the species

York	Furbearers


 

It is very important for trappers to know furbearer natural history. Understanding each species’ 
habits and habitat helps you select good set locations. Set location is much more important than 
set construction. Landowners may be able to supply some information about the animals on 
their land, particularly problem animals, but pre‐season scouting will help you determine if the 

location is good for your intended species. 

Scouting includes observations of animal tracks, scats, droppings and other signs. The ability to 
read sign is an acquired skill, and the information included in this chapter can help you develop 
this skill.  

Sets mentioned in this section are more fully described in Chapters 10 and 11. Examples of 
furbearer tracks are located in Appendix 2. Drawings of the scat of each of these animals are 
found in Appendix 3. Up‐to‐date range maps for each species in the northeastern United States

48,"Muskrat	(Ondatra	zibethicus)                   

Muskrats resemble large rats with long, 
vertically flattened tails. They reach a total 
length of about 26 inches, including the tail, 

which is about as long as the body. The 
maximum weight is 3 to 4 ½  pounds. Their 
pelts are usually a rich, glossy brown with 

brown‐tipped, dark   gray underfur, but the 
pelts may range from tan to black. The belly 

is silvery gray to light rusty tan. Although 
they are small, muskrats are abundant, and 
their annual dollar value probably exceeds 

all other North American furbearers. 

Reproduction
Muskrats breed through the spring and summer and are capable of producing many offspring. 

While the usual number of young per litter is 5 to 6, as many as 11 have been recorded. 
Muskrats may have 2 to 3 litters per year, and their gestation period (length of development 

inside the mother) is 22‐30 days. Dens may be bank burrows or small dome‐shaped huts in 
relatively shallow water. 

Habitat

Muskrats are largely aquatic. They are found in fresh and brackish water marshes, swamps, 
streams, lakes, and ponds. Nearly every older farm pond has muskrats, and nearly any semi‐
permanent watercourse has at least a few. Beaver ponds, both active and inactive, are suitable 

muskrat habitat. 

Habits

Like most other furbearers, muskrats are most active at night (nocturnal) or around dawn and 
dusk (crepuscular). They are frequently seen during the day, however. They travel extensively 
along watercourses, even small spring runs, or over land. These travels are most frequent during 

the fall and right after ice‐out inhe spring. 

Trails, channels, plant cuttings, tracks along banks, and scats are all signs of muskrat activity. 
Muskrats develop habitual travel routes on land and in water, which they keep open with 

constant traffic and pruning. These trails are readily evident to the experienced eye. Active bank 
burrows about 4 to 8 inches in diameter, feed beds of cut grasses or cattails, and huts are also 
positive muskrat signs. 


When muskrat populations are dense, adult males tend to fight, leaving a large number of cut

49,"Although their teeth, like those of other rodents, are adapted to feeding on vegetation, 

muskrats will eat clams, mussels, frogs, and fish as well as cattails, rushes, water lilies, and other 
aquatic plants. They are also fond of fruit and grains, if available near water.   


Disease
Muskrats suffer from several diseases, including tularemia and hemorrhagic septicemia.  Since 
humans can be infected with tularemia, avoid any contact with muskrats found dead or dying of 

no apparent cause. Wearing rubber or plastic gloves while skinning trapped muskrat can 
minimize the risk of contracting tularemia. 


Trapping	Tactics
Muskrat pelts are best in winter or early spring before biting occurs. However, pelts taken in late 
fall are also marketable.   


Muskrats are not trap shy. In most instances, well‐darkened traps set under water need no 
covering at all. Muskrats may be taken in bait sets, runway or channel sets,    and float sets. Some 
of the most productive blind sets are those placed in narrow waterways, along stream or pond 

banks where recent muskrat signs are present, or at feed beds. Whenever possible, use small 
body‐gripping traps for muskrats. Foothold or guarded foothold traps in sizes 1 and 1½      are also 

appropriate, and the sets should be made to ensure the animal is submerged. Where the water 
is not deep enough to ensure submersion (about a foot), a guarded foothold trap on a slide wire 
to deeper water or a body‐gripping trap must be used. This is necessary because      if a standard 

foothold trap is used and the muskrat isn’t submerged, it may twist and pull until it escapes, 
leaving its foot in the trap. This is called “wring‐off,” and is to be avoided at any cost. Using 

recommended techniques and state of the art traps, this can     be completely avoided.  
Submersion sets and body‐gripping traps will eliminate this problem. If a trapper is not 
absolutely sure that he or she can submerge a muskrat at a particular site, the trapper must use 

either a body‐gripping trap or a guarded trap, or move the set to another     location where the 
catch can be submerged. Trappers who finds evidence of wring‐off, or find live muskrat in their 
traps, should immediately re‐evaluate their trapping methods to prevent this from happening 

again. 

Baits	and	Lures

Muskrat lures and baits are numerous. Muskrat musk is frequently used in spring trapping. In 
the fall and winter, trappers use oil of sweet flag, spearmint, anise or some other sweet‐smelling 
oil as an attractant. Fish oil is also attractive to muskrats. Apples, parsnips, and carrots are all 

used successfully as muskrat baits. Exercise caution when using baits and lures containing anise

50,"Mink	(Mustela	vison)
Mink are medium‐sized members of 

the weasel family. Like others in the 
weasel family, they have long, 

slender bodies and short legs. Large 
males reach lengths in excess of 26 
inches, with tails about 9 inches long 

and weights up to 3 ½ pounds. 
Females are smaller than males. 

Mink  pelts are usually rich, glossy 

brown, but pale brown or nearly 
black mink occur.  Mink can be 
distinguished from weasel by their white chin patch and brown belly. While weasel are light 

underneath, mink will only occasionally have white on their bellies. The bushy tail is usually a bit 
darker than the body. The mink’s short, dense underfur is pale brown. 


Reproduction
Mink mate in late winter from January through March. Litters of 2 to 6 young are born in April or 
May after a variable gestation period averaging about 42 days. Only a single litter is born each 

year. 

Dens may be in debris piles, hollow logs, rock piles, or abandoned muskrat houses or burrows 
near water. Females usually remain near dens, while males wander over considerable distances. 


Habitat
Mink are most often found near streams, lakes, marshes, or swamps, but they may travel 
considerable distances from those wetlands. 


Habits
Mink are primarily nocturnal but will often hunt during the day. Feeding mainly on fish, frogs, 

birds and small mammals, these predators hunt primarily along watercourses. They are equally 
at home on land and water, but most of their traveling is done along stream or lake edges. Like 
raccoon, they enter  the water readily to avoid obstructions. Mink are curious and thorough in 

their search for food. Nearly any hole, brush pile, hollow log, or other potential food‐producing 
cover along their route will be visited. They are creatures of habit, visiting the same places on 
each trip through an area. 


Males visit small feeder streams, spring runs, and even drainage tiles in their rounds; usually 
travelling longer distances than females. Headwater areas are frequently the denning areas of 
resident females. Mink scats are generally abundant in such areas. During the winter, mink

51,"Disease

Generally, mink have few diseases. However, they are susceptible to distemper and pollutants 
such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 


Trapping	Tactics
Mink fur is best from about mid‐November until the beginning of January. Fur from animals 
taken later in the season is likely to be “singed” (curling of guard hair) or discolored. 


Mink are taken in a wide variety of sets. Water sets for mink are easier to make than are dry‐
land sets. Blind sets where mink tracks enter or leave the water, at bank holes (pocket sets) or in 
small spring runs or drainage tiles are all effective methods . Cubby sets, particularly artificial 

bank‐hole cubbies using mink lure, are good mink sets. Dirt‐hole sets for fox    or raccoon 
occasionally take mink. 

Mink are strong and quick, so traps for them should be strong and fast. Coil‐spring or under‐

spring traps in sizes 1 or 1½ are preferred. Longspring traps can be used successfully with the 
added weight advantage for submersion sets. Small body‐gripping traps (especially        with double 
springs) will take mink. Submersion sets should always be used with foothold traps. Pan tension 

should be very light for mink.  Just enough to keep the trap set until stepped on.             

Baits	and	Lures

Muskrat or mink musk, scats, urine and beaver castor are all attractive to mink. Fish oil alone or 
in combination with the above ingredients is also a good lure. There are many commercial lures 
on the market as well. 


Good lures and blind sets are usually the most successful techniques with mink, but fresh fish, 
poultry, or muskrat flesh also work well as mink baits as long as special care is taken not to

52,"Beaver	(Castor	canadensis)
The beaver is a large, aquatic rodent with 

webbed rear feet and a horizontally 
flattened, paddle‐shaped tail. The largest 

North American rodent, beaver may be more 
than 45 inches long, including the tail, and 
reach weights of more than 60 pounds. With 

soft, dense underfur ranging from pale to 
chocolate  brown and rich brown guard hairs, 
their glossy, durable coat is a valuable fur.

         

Reproduction

Beaver are apparently monogamous (have only one mate). They breed from January to March, 
with the young born about 128 days later. Litters range in size from 1 to 8 young, but 2 to 4 are 
usual. The young remain with the parents for about two years, maturing at 1 to 2 years of age. 

Beaver have one litter per year. 

Dens are in either large bank holes (burrows) or large, dome‐shaped, stick‐and‐mud lodges. 
Entrances and exits are generally below the surface of the water. 


Habitat
Beaver are semi‐aquatic mammals, generally found near water. Young adults looking for a new 
area to live may travel considerable distances along very small water courses.  Suitable habitat 

may be natural, or dams may be constructed by the beaver where other conditions are 
favorable. 

Beaver are the one animal in New York (other than humans) which actively alters it’s 

environments to suit its needs. 

Habits

Beaver are mainly nocturnal or crepuscular. They prefer rather deep water and will construct 
mud‐and‐stick dams to create those preferred conditions. Typically, each adult beaver pair 
constructs a lodge that they occupy with their kits and yearlings. 


Beaver feed on both bark and aquatic vegetation, and winter food stores (feed piles) are 
composed of quantities of branches lodged in the bottom of the pond. Their preferred foods 
include aspen (poplar), alder, and willow, but several other types of trees and aquatic plants are

53,"Generally, beaver use habitual runways in their travels. In late winter, they go considerable 

distances to areas of open water. Secretions from the castors (scent glands) are deposited on 
scent mounds made of mud along the banks as a means of communication. 

Active beaver colonies can be identified by the presence of dams, channels, lodges, freshly cut 

trees or brush, tracks, and mud scent mounds.   

Disease
Beaver are susceptible to tularemia, so trappers should follow the same precautions mentioned 

for muskrat (avoid any contact with beaver found dead or dying of no apparent cause and wear 
rubber or plastic gloves while skinning). 


Trapping	Tactics
Beaver pelts are most prime in winter and early spring though like muskrats, fall caught pelts are 
also marketable. 


Trail, bait, spillway, scent mound, and channel sets are effective in trapping in open water. 
Channel sets are also effective in under‐ice trapping. Several kinds of bait sets using fresh twigs 
or other vegetation are also used under the ice. Slanted‐pole sets and bait‐pen sets (basically 

underwater cubbies) are two popular types. Most trappers prefer large body‐gripping traps or 
strong size 3 or 4 traps for beaver. All sets should be placed in the water. When using foothold 
traps for beaver, submersion wires or cables equipped with one‐way sliding locks must be used, 

unless the trap is anchored to prevent the beaver from reaching the surface. At least three feet 
of water is needed to submerge beaver consistently. Placing traps on or within a certain 
distance of dams   or lodges may be illegal in some areas. In addition, some areas that do not 

have an open otter trapping season may require the use of offset triggers on body gripping 
traps. Check the regulation in the New York Hunting and Trapping Guide or DEC’s website 

http://www.dec.ny.gov. Ask your local Environmental Conservation Officer (ECO) if in doubt 
about regulations. 

Baits	and	Lures

Castoreum (the secretion of the castors) and oil glands located under the skin between the 
beaver’s hind legs are the most frequently used beaver lures. Twigs or sections of branches from

54,"River	Otter	(Lontra	canadensis)
Otter are large aquatic 

members of the weasel 
family. They have the typical 

weasel shape, reach up to 43 
inches long (including a 
heavy, tapered tail up to 17 

inches long), and weigh up to 
24 pounds. Otter are brown 
above and gray below with 

very glossy pelts. Otter fur is
highly durable. 

Otter have webbed feet which make them very well adapted for life in the water. Their scats are 

highly variable, but usually they contain masses of fish scales and bones. Otter slides and 
twisted tufts of grass (scent posts) are other signs of this highly prized furbearer. 


Reproduction
Young otter are born in April and May, with average litter sizes of 1 to 5 young. The family group 
remains together for about a year. Otter dens are frequently located in bank holes, hollow logs, 

or abandoned beaver lodges. Like other mustelids, otter are delayed implanters. 

Habitat
Otter are primarily aquatic, but they travel overland for considerable distances when moving 

between streams. They may visit any wetland area, including rivers, lakes, beaver ponds, 
streams, ponds and even small brooks within their range.             


Habits
Otter are almost entirely carnivorous (flesh eating).  Food items include fish, crayfish, clams, 
snakes, frogs, tadpoles, salamanders, and a variety of water insects. At times of food 

scarcity otters may prey on muskrats and small birds and eat such things as blueberries and 
corn. Active at any time of day or night, otter cover a large hunting area, as much as 62 linear 

miles or more along water courses. Otter frequently travel in pairs or family groups as they 
make the rounds of their hunting territories. 

Even though young otter must be taught to swim, they are soon able to catch fish. They will eat 

the most easily caught species. Although otter reportedly take trout, they eat rough fish such as 
bullheads and suckers more frequently than the more elusive trout. 

Otter use slides and “rolling places” along their routes. Often, tufts of grass in these areas will be 

twisted and scent‐marked by anal gland secretions. Abundant droppings are often found in large

Otter pelts are best in late fall or early winter.  Like mink, otter pelts may exhibit singe if taken in 
late winter or spring. 

Otter are extremely wary and trap shy. They are also quick and very powerful. Traps for otter 

must be heavy, fast, and strong. Most trappers use size      3 or 4 foothold traps or large or medium 
body‐gripping traps. In all cases, they must be very carefully concealed. All sets should be placed 

in the water. Sets using foothold traps should use a submersion wire or cable with a one‐way 
sliding lock. Care should be taken   with trap placement in order to get a proper hold using 
foothold traps. Traps that are sprung by the otter’s body will result in a trap‐wise otter. 


Water sets at the base of trails leading to the top of a slide are much more effective than are 
sets at the base of the slide. Carefully hidden sets at an otter toilet/latrine can also be 
productive. Bait sets are sometimes successful, but lure alone often works better for these 

elusive animals. Blind sets in narrow spring runs, channels, or spillways will also take otter. 

Baits	and	Lures
Otter musk, used sparingly, is the best lure for otter. Beaver castor will also attract them. Other 

furbearers such as raccoon and beaver are also attracted by these lures. Some trappers use

56,"Opossum	(Didelphis	virginiana)
The opossum is about the size of a fat house 

cat. Resembling a large, shaggy, cream‐to‐
gray colored rat with a pointed snout full of 

teeth, this animal can reach lengths 
(including tail) of 35‐40 inches and weights up 
to about 10 pounds. With sparse, coarse, 

white guard hairs  over black‐tipped creamy 
underfur, the opossum has a light to dark 
gray body with black legs. The ears and tail 

are naked, and both are black at the base and 
lighter at the tips. Opossum pelts must be 

handled carefully to be worth showing to a 
fur buyer.  

Reproduction

Opossum breed during the spring and summer, producing 1 or 2 litters each year. The young are 
born after a two‐week gestation and up to 18 may enter the female’s pouch (the opossum is the 
only North American marsupial). Generally only 7 to 8 young survive to leave the pouch about 

two months later. 

Habitat

Opossum are found in brush, hedgerows, and orchards. Woodland edges, croplands, 
bottomlands, and even buildings are also likely areas. Dens are most often located in hollow 
trees, fallen logs, or burrows abandoned by woodchucks or skunks. 


Habits
These rather primitive animals are mainly nocturnal. They feed on nearly anything, animal or 
vegetable, fresh or rotten. Opossum are not at all trap shy and may be taken in most any kind of 

set. Having relatively small brains dominated by the olfactory (smell) regions, they are easily 
attracted by sweet  or foul odors. Rather slow and unwary, opossum often employ threats or 

play dead to avoid predation. Their tracks resemble many tiny, overlapping hand prints with a 
central drag mark made by the tail. The scats are variable, depending on the type of food eaten. 
Opossum tend to remain in    a relatively restricted area. 


Trapping	Tactics
Opossum pelts are at their best from November to March. 

Very few trappers actually set traps for opossum. Most are taken in sets made for more valuable 

species, particularly fox, raccoon, or mink. Dirt‐hole sets and cubby sets are among the more

57,"Most trappers prefer size 1 or 1½ traps for opossum. Medium‐sized body‐gripping traps are 

effective where catching domestic animals is not a danger. Since opossum are not trap shy, they 
can be trapped effectively using box traps.  

Baits	and	Lures

Nearly any bait or lure will attract opossum. Poultry entrails and tainted baits (e.g. rotting fish, 
meat, or eggs, or rank cheese) are all quite effective. Using expensive or elaborate baits or lures

58,"Striped	Skunk	(Mephitis	mephitis)
The striped skunk needs 

little introduction. Skunks 
are black and white, 

ranging from nearly all 
black to black with a 
single broad white band 

from crown to tail tip. 
Large skunk may reach 
lengths up to 28 inches including about 10 inches of heavily furred tail.  Weights up to 13 

pounds   have been recorded. Skunks have glossy guard hairs and dense underfur. Their musk 
glands have a very strong odor. 


Reproduction
Skunk mate during the first warm weather in February and March. Litters of up to 10 young 
(usually about 5) are born in May after a 63‐day gestation period. The young remain with the 

adult female until midsummer. 

Dens are found under buildings, rock piles, sawmill slab piles, hollow logs, or abandoned 
woodchuck burrows. Winter dens are usually some form of ground burrow. 


Habitat
Skunks prefer rather open country. Farmland with a mixture of brush, woodlands, pastures and 
cropland is ideal skunk habitat. 


Habits
Skunks are mainly nocturnal, but their activity period includes both dawn and dusk. They eat 

large numbers of insects and small rodents as well as frogs, snakes, eggs, birds, berries, fruits, 
and carrion(animals found dead). Skunks become inactive during cold winter weather, but they 
emerge to feed during warm periods. Males     wander widely during the breeding season.  Skunks 

depend on their scent glands for defense. As a result of this effective tactic, skunks are relatively 
unwary and easily observed. 

Diseases

Skunk are susceptible to distemper and rabies. The symptoms for these diseases are very 
similar. In the final stages, the animal might be indifferent to the trapper’s approach, have 

crusty eyes, shake or quiver, and drool or foam at the mouth. Rabies can infect humans, while 
distemper can be caught by   dogs and pets. 

The trapper should avoid being bitten and always use rubber gloves when handling skunk. Any 

contact with skunks found dead or dying of no apparent cause should be avoided. Be sure to use

59,"should be killed without damaging the brain. Wearing rubber gloves, the trapper should remove 

the animal from the trap and place it in a sturdy plastic bag, which is then securely fastened. The 
trapper should immediately wash the wound and go to a local doctor. Then, the suspected 
animal  should be delivered to the county health office for a rabies test. 


Trapping	Tactics
Skunk pelts are best from November to January. Their habit of denning during cold weather 

means that they must be trapped most intensely during the early part of the November to 
January period or during warm spells. 

Skunks are not trap shy, and they can be taken in a wide variety of sets. Many are caught in dirt‐

hole sets for fox or raccoon. Cubby sets, dirt‐hole sets and sets near dens account for large 
numbers of skunk. Size 1 to 1½ foothold traps are most frequently used.  Medium‐sized body‐
gripping traps are effective for skunk, but they must   be used very carefully to avoid catching and 

killing domestic animals. Box traps also may be used effectively for trapping skunk. 

Baits	and	Lures
Fish oil and skunk musk are good skunk lures. Sweet‐smelling lures such as oil of anise or honey 

can also draw skunk to your sets. The best lure for skunks is your favorite fox or coyote lure! 
Fresh or rotten flesh is good for skunk as well as opossum. Because     of their broad food

60,"Raccoon	(Procyon	lotor)
Raccoon are heavy‐bodied animals 

with relatively long legs, a pointed 
snout, and a moderately long, 

ringed tail. The coat has a grizzled 
or stippled appearance with 
overall color ranging from gray to 

chocolate brown. The black mask 
and the tail ringed with dark and 
light bands are distinctive. 

Raccoon reach   lengths of more 
than 41 inches including a tail 
about 12 inches long. They may 

weigh in excess of 33 pounds. The 
banded guard hairs mix with silky underfur, which ranges from pale tan to chocolate brown. 

Raccoon tracks resemble tiny human hand and foot prints, with the relatively long     toes visible in 
soft surfaces.  

Reproduction

The young are born in April or May after a 63‐day gestation period. Litters of 2 to 7 are common, 
with four being average. Raccoon have one litter per year, and the young remain with the 
female into the fall. 


Habitat
Raccoon are highly adaptable animals found over most of North America. They are often 

observed along wooded streams, lake shores, marshes, and swamps. They also live in upland 
areas where their favorite foods are found. Raccoon are well adapted to farm buildings or 
human dwellings, and populations within towns and suburban        areas can be surprisingly high. 


Raccoon den in hollow trees, logs, rocky ledges, and even in burrows made by other animals. 
Den trees can be recognized readily by smoothed bark, scratches, hair, and possible scats. A 
wise trapper will not disturb dens since they are often used year after year by the raccoons in 

that area. Caution should be used in setting traps near dens during the hunting season since 
coon dogs may go to such sites. 


Habits
Raccoon eat almost anything that is available. They are efficient predators, feeding on nestling 
birds, eggs, fish, frogs, crayfish, mussels and insects. During the late summer and fall, their diet 

contains large amounts of fruits and grain. Black cherries, apples, grapes, corn, beechnuts, and

61,"Although raccoon are good swimmers, they confine most of their activities to the banks and 

shallow‐water sections of lakes and streams. They will detour into water to avoid obstructions, 
and they use crossing logs when available. Raccoon are natural explorers with curiosity that can 

be used to a trapper’s advantage. 

Although raccoon become inactive during the winter, they are active during warm spells and 
thaws. Good catches can be taken throughout the winter during these periods of activity. 


Disease
Raccoon are hosts to distemper and dermatophilus as well as rabies. Contact with raccoon 
found dead or dying without apparent cause should be avoided. Since dermatophilus can infect 

humans, trappers should wear rubber gloves when handling any raccoon that has flaky skin or 
patches of missing fur. The same precautions described     for skunk should be followed (refer to 

the disease section under skunk for additional information). As mentioned on page 20, raccoon 
roundworm is a concern and trappers should take appropriate precautions to guard against it. 

Trapping	Tactics

Raccoon pelts are best from about mid‐November to January. Depending on the weather, high 
quality fur may be taken as late as February. Raccoon fur is quite prone to rubbing damage, 

singeing or springiness later in the season, and will be worth much less. 

Many raccoons are taken in dirt  ‐hole or spring‐hole sets for foxes. Cubby, obstruction, and blind 
sets where they enter or leave the water are all good raccoon takers. Sets in spring runs or 

irrigation ditches often are productive. Raccoon may also be caught in leaning pole sets. 

Raccoon are strong, with rather slender legs and feet. Strong sized 1 foothold traps or double 
jawed 1 ½ traps are used for raccoon.  A good foot trap for raccoon catches them on the paw, 

not the wrist or leg, and is small enough to prevent the raccoon from getting its snout under the 
trap jaws.  Foot encapsulating  traps work exceptionally well for raccoon and almost eliminate 
unintended catches  Medium‐sized body‐gripping traps are good for raccoon, but they must be 

used very carefully to avoid catching free‐ranging domestic animals. Large box traps can be 
quite effective in taking raccoon. Some trappers prefer to use longer    trap chains with drags. 

However, if drags are used, they should be of sufficient size (four feet long and three inches 
across) and made of hardwood because these animals tend to chew at the drag. 

Baits	and	Lures

Raccoon are attracted to a wide variety of lures, including sweet‐smelling lures such as oil of 
anise and foul‐smelling lures like fish oil. Fresh or rotten flesh, marshmallows, grape jelly, honey, 

fish, apples, singed (burned) corn, and mussels are all good raccoon baits. Raccoon gland lures 
may be very   attractive to hunting dogs, so they should be used very carefully at selective set

62,"Red	Fox	(Vulpes	fulva)
The red fox resembles a small 

shepherd dog with a bushy tail, 
erect ears, pointed snout, and 

long legs. It is usually reddish‐
yellow to rusty‐orange with a 
white‐tipped tail, and black legs, 

feet and ears. Darker color 
variations known as cross and 
silver fox occur in some areas.  Fox 

look larger than they really are. Larger specimens reach lengths of about 42 inches, including a 
bushy tail about three‐fifths as long as the body. Maximum weights are 13 to 15 pounds. The 

pelt features long, glossy guard hairs with dense underfur ranging from nearly white to medium 
gray‐brown in the reddish individuals. 

Reproduction

Red fox breed in late winter with the pups born about 53 days later. Both adults may take part 
in rearing the litter, which usually includes 4 to 9 young. Fox have only one litter per year. 

Fox den in abandoned woodchuck burrows, old slab piles, under abandoned buildings, or in          

small rock caves. They may dig their own dens in porous soils. 

Habitat
Red fox prefer a mixture of mature, open forest and open fields. Farming country often supports 

excellent fox populations. 

Habits

Red fox are mainly nocturnal, but they are frequently active during the day. Fond of winter 
sunbathing, they can often be seen on slopes with a southern exposure. Fox feed mainly on 
insects, rodents, some carrion, and fruits, nuts, and berries when those foods are available. 


Red fox often hunt and   travel along field edges, game trails, wood roads, and cleared rights‐of‐
way. They tend to hunt along hedgerows and other strips of cover rather than the central parts 
of open areas. Red fox are wary and have excellent hearing, good eyesight, and finely tuned 

scenting abilities. They come to  baits cautiously, tending to scan the area carefully from an 
elevated spot such as a log or ant hill before moving to a trap site. 

Red fox range over a rather large area (up to one square mile), marking their travels much like

63,"Diseases
Red fox are susceptible to sarcoptic mange, distemper, and rabies. The precautions mentioned 
earlier with respect to being bitten or handling dead or dying animals also apply here. The 

symptoms of mange on a fox are: flaky skin, missing fur (especially on the tail), crusty patches or 
squinting eyes. Any fox  that may have mange should be handled with caution using rubber 

gloves, since mange mites can infect humans and domestic animals.  Be especially careful when 
killing the fox and try not to stand on the fox because that might expose you to the disease. If 
the fox has only a little mange (such as just a little flaky skin on the lower legs), the fox can be 

carried with rubber gloves and frozen in a plastic bag. After two weeks, the mange mites will be 
dead, and the fox can be skinned. If the fox has more mange, the pelt will probably be 
worthless, and the trapper should place the entire fox carcass in a plastic bag for disposal or 

bury it deep enough to prevent dogs or fox from digging it up. Many trappers also remove the 
trap and keep it in a plastic bag until it can be re‐ed, along with any other equipment 

involved. Never release a fox with mange because this disease is always fatal to red fox. 

Trapping	Tactics
Fox pelts are best from about November through the beginning of January. After that time, the 

color of the pelts may begin to fade. 

Because fox are cautious and have excellent noses, traps and sets must be well hidden and free 
from foreign odors. Good fox trappers are careful trap handlers     and set makers. 


The dirt‐hole set and variations of it have taken more fox than all other sets combined. Dirt‐hole 
sets can be made more dog‐proof by keeping a size 1½ coilspring trap as close to the bait‐hole 

as possible, placing the trap so the fox comes across the jaw, and using a selective bait, fox 
urine, and gland lure. Because fox do not like to get wet, spring‐hole sets will yield a number of 
animals each year. The scent post set takes advantage of a fox’s home range marking system. 

Flat sets are also effective. 

Baits	and	Lures

Fox urine is an excellent fox lure. Fox are also attracted to a variety of rotten flesh baits, fish oil, 
and skunk or mink musk. Many commercial lures are available, but many trappers make their 
own. A wise trapper will test the lure on a few sets before using it on the rest of the line. Red fox 

gland lures are also among the most effective and selective lures for fox. Baits are generally 
made from fresh or partially decomposed red meats. Some trappers use pieces of honeycomb

64,"Gray	Fox	(Urocyon	cinereoargenteus)

The gray fox is much like the red fox in 

general shape and is up to 42 inches long 
(including the tail) with a bushy, black‐
tipped tail about one half the length of the 

body. Gray fox are generally somewhat 
smaller than reds with weights up to about 
13 pounds.   The gray’s pelt is made up of 

mixed dark and light guard hairs over a 
light gray‐brown underfur. The gray fox’s 
flanks, neck, and legs are a rusty tan to 

orange.  

Reproduction

Gray fox breed in January and February with the young born about 50 to 60 days later. Litters of 
1 to 7 young are normal. In many respects, the reproductive behavior and denning habits of gray 
fox are similar to those listed for red fox. 


Habitat
Gray fox seem to prefer denser and moister cover than do red fox. They are found in overgrown 
fields, swamps, and cut‐over woodland. 


Habits
The gray fox is chiefly a nocturnal predator. As omnivores, gray fox consume insects, rodents, 
fruits, and berries. Like the red fox, the gray fox is an excellent mouser. Gray fox are quite similar 

to their red relatives in behavior. Gray fox and red fox are rather intolerant of one another,   but 
their habitat preferences tend to keep them from having a great amount of interaction. 

Diseases

Gray fox are susceptible to both distemper and rabies. The precautions mentioned earlier 
regarding being bitten or handling animals found dead or dying should be followed with gray fox 

as well. 

Trapping	Tactics
The same trapping techniques used for red fox may be used in trapping grays. 


Baits	and	Lures
The same baits and lures used for red fox trapping can be used in trapping gray fox. Gray fox 
urine will attract gray fox. Commercial lures are made for gray fox, but lures made for red fox 

will also work quite effectively. As with red fox, gland lures are among the   most effective and

65,"Coyote	(Canis	latrans)
The Eastern 

coyote is quite 
similar to a large, 

pale gray fox in 
coloration and 
shape.  They have 

gray to reddish‐
gray fur with 
slightly rusty legs, 

feet, and ears. 
Large specimens 

may weigh up to 
65 pounds with a 
total length of about 55 inches. Average weights are between 30     and 45 pounds. The bushy tail, 

about 18 inches long, is carried low when the animal is running. Its ears are erect and its tail is 
not curled. 

Reproduction

Coyote breed in January through early March, with a gestation period of about 60 days.  The 
young are born in March, April, and May. A litter of 6 pups is common. Dens occur in loose soil, 
rock ledges or other good cover. 


Habitat
Large areas of open woodland, brushy wetlands and rough, broken areas are the best areas to 

seek coyote in eastern Northern America. Occurring over much of North America, coyote have 
adapted to many types of habitat. 

Habits

Like the other members of the dog family, coyote are mainly nocturnal predators. They eat a 
wide variety of both animal and plant foods. Although small mammals make up a large part of 

their diet, they also prey on larger animals under some conditions. 

Coyote are travelers, covering a hunting route of 3 to 15 square miles depending on habitat 
quality. They are quite fast, reaching speeds up to about 40 miles per hour in short bursts. 

Sometimes hunting in pairs or family units, they have the endurance to run down larger prey. 
They will feed on winter‐killed game or  other carrion when such food is available. 

Coyote are extremely wary. With excellent scenting capabilities, they can easily detect poorly

66,"ranging habits, coyote may not pass through a particular area for several days to weeks. Thus, 

sets that are not immediately successful should not be abandoned too soon. 

Diseases
Coyote are susceptible to sarcoptic mange, distemper and rabies. Follow the precautions 

mentioned earlier for skunk and fox. 

Trapping	Tactics
Coyote pelts are best during the November through January period. Dirt‐hole sets as well as 

other fox sets using size 1.75 or 2 traps are excellent fall coyote sets. When using #2 traps, use 
only those with thick jaws to avoid cutting the coyote’s foot. 

Baits	and	Lures

Many commercial lures are available to coyote trappers. Coyote urine and gland lures are 
effective. A strong‐smelling oil is a good base for the lure. Mink or skunk musk can improve the 
cold weather performance of the lure. Baits mentioned for use with fox can also be used in

67,"Weasels:			Long‐tailed	(Mustela	frenata),	and	Short‐tailed	(Mustela
erminea)

Weasels are long‐bodied animals with short legs. During most of 

the year, they are brown with a white throat and belly. In the 
winter, most become all white with only a black‐tipped tail. The 
larger, long‐tailed weasel reaches a length of about 18 inches 

total with a tail about 6 inches long and a weight of about 13 
ounces for males. Male short‐tailed weasels, or ermine, reach a 
length of about 13 inches with a tail about 3 inches long and a 

weight of about six ounces. Females of both species are smaller 
than males. Weasel pelts   feature short, dense underfur and 
abundant, short, glossy guard hairs. Color ranges from white to 

cream in winter specimens. 

Reproduction

Weasel mate during the summer, but the young do not begin to 
develop until the late winter or early spring. The single yearly 
litters of both species are born in April or May.  Litters of 4 to 8 

young are normal for both species. Female long‐tailed weasel breed during their      first summer, 
but males do not mature until the next season. 

Both types of weasel den in rock piles, old buildings, burrows, and hollow logs or stumps. Ermine 

dens are often lined with the fur of mice they have eaten. 

Habitat
Weasels seem to need standing water, but they are found in almost all habitats. Brushy fields, 

hedgerows or stone walls are excellent places to look for signs. Weasels are tireless in hunting 
mainly small mammals and a few birds. Weasels are very efficient killers, using their canine 

teeth to pierce the  skulls of their prey. Prey up to the size of rabbits is most commonly taken, 
but larger animals are sometimes attacked either as potential prey or in defense of young. 

Where abundant prey is found, weasel will sometimes kill in large numbers. Excess prey items 

are sometimes hidden (cached) for later use. Weasel depredations of entire chicken flocks are a 
result of that instinctive killing and caching behavior. Weasels eat the entire prey. They do not 
merely suck the blood of their prey as many people believe. 


Weasels are not wary of humans. Larger predators take weasel on occasion but these little 
predators, equipped with needle teeth, a shrill scream, and foul‐smelling musk, are formidable

68,"Trapping	Tactics

Weasel pelts are best in late fall or winter after they have turned white.  Early caught weasel 
that are brown or just turning to white are of less value. 

Weasels are not very trap shy. Cubby sets, including weasel boxes using bloody baits, and dirt‐

hole sets along stone walls or   logs, make good weasel sets. Size 0 and 1 foothold traps with very 
light pan action should be used. Small body‐gripping traps, set properly, can be used effectively 

for weasel (household rat‐sized “snap” traps can be used). Large foothold traps can be used as 
body‐gripping traps, particularly  if one jaw is propped up. Small box traps are also effective. 

Baits	and	Lures

Weasels are interested in fresh, bloody baits. Baits need not be large; a chicken head or rabbit 
head is enough. Weasel musk is an excellent weasel lure that is very useful for other animals as 
well. Weasel scats are also good lures. Fish oil or another foul‐smelling oil will attract them. A

69,"Fisher	(Pekania	pennanti)
Fisher are large dark‐brown to black 

weasel‐like animals. They resemble a 
large, short‐legged black cat or a 

very large, heavy, dark mink. The 
guard hairs are frequently light‐
tipped, giving the animal a frosted 

appearance. Males reach lengths of 
more than 40 inches including a 
dark‐tipped bushy   tail about 14 

inches long. Large males may weigh as much as 18 pounds, but females seldom reach 6 ½  
pounds. Small fisher may be distinguished from large marten (Martes americana) by the 

absence of a buff throat patch. 

Reproduction
Fisher produce single litters of 1 to 5 young in late March or early April. They breed immediately 

after having their young, but they experience delayed implantation like several other members 
of the weasel family. The young remain with the female through the summer. 

Fisher dens are usually in hollow trees  with a fairly large, high opening. At times, rock crevices 

may also be used. Fisher frequently have several dens in their territory. 

Habitat
Fisher habitat is varied, but they seem to prefer forested regions. They also occur in agricultural 

areas and, in recent years, suburban areas. Fisher are expanding their range into central and 
western New York where they were rarely or never seen even a few short years ago. 


Habits
Fisher are extremely agile and active predators. Very much at home in trees, they prey on red 
squirrels and occasionally pine marten and raccoon. Fisher are one of the few predators that 

regularly prey on porcupine. They also eat berries, nuts, mice, birds, and other vertebrates. 
When abundant food is located,    such as a dead deer, fisher will den nearby until the supply is 
gone. 


These tireless hunters range over a large area, traveling at any time of day or night, frequently 
using well‐established hunting trails. They are solitary except during the breeding season and 
when young are with the females. The fisher gives off a foul musk when disturbed. 


Trapping	Tactics

70,"Leaning pole sets, cubby sets and dirt‐hole sets are generally considered best for fisher, and size 

1½ or 2 foothold traps are adequate. Medium‐sized, body‐gripping traps are effective for fisher, 
but they must be used cautiously to avoid killing domestic animals.  Box traps can also be used 
effectively. 


Baits	and	Lures
Fisher musk, fish oil, beaver castor, and skunk essence are attractive to fisher whether used 

alone or in combinations. These lures can be used with bait such as fresh beaver flesh to

71,"Bobcat	(Lynx	rufus)

Reaching lengths to about 36 

inches with a tail about five inches 
long and a weight of up to about 33 
pounds, bobcats resemble very 

large, short‐tailed housecats. 
Bobcats are tawny to rusty with 
black spots, especially on their light 

undersides. 

Reproduction

Bobcat may breed at any time of 
the year, but spring mating is most 
common. A litter of 2 to 4 young 

are born about 50 days later. 
Bobcat dens are usually in rock crevices, hollow logs, or dense windfalls. 

Habitat

In eastern North America, bobcat are usually found in brush lots, heavily forested areas or in 
dense woodland swamps. They also occur in some agricultural areas. Like fisher, bobcat have 
been expanding their range into central and western New York. 


Habits
Bobcats are primarily nocturnal, solitary predators. Small mammals, birds, and occasional larger 
animals like beaver or deer are hunted by stalking. Rodents and rabbits are the most frequent 

prey. Large prey animals and fresh carrion are usually covered between feeding periods. 

Bobcat wander widely within a moderately large home area visiting      traditional trails around 
rocky ledges, stream banks, beaver ponds, or bogs. They also follow old logging roads and deer 

trails.  

Trapping	Tactics
Bobcats pelts are at their best from late November to February. 


Dirt‐hole sets, cubby sets, and leaning pole sets will take bobcat. Most trappers prefer size 2 and 
3 foothold traps (with a jaw spread of five and three‐quarters inches or less) for bobcat.  

Baits	and	Lures

Lures can be more effective than are baits for bobcat. Fish oil, bobcat anal glands or urine, oil of 
catnip, skunk essence, and beaver castor are all used as bobcat lure ingredients. Several

72,"American	(Pine)	Marten	(Martes	americana)

Marten are medium‐sized, light‐ to dark‐brown 

weasel‐like animals. Buff to yellow‐orange fur 
covers the underside of the throat and the 
upper chest, making them easy to distinguish 

from similar species. Males may be up to 35 
inches long, reaching weights of up to 3 pounds. 
Females are   smaller, averaging 22 inches long 

and weighing about 2 pounds. 

Reproduction

Marten produce single litters of 1 to 5 (average 2 to 3) young annually. The young are born in 
late March or early April. The adults breed soon after the young are born, but they experience 
delayed implantation like several other members of the weasel family. 

Marten dens are usually in hollow logs or trees, but occasionally they may use a ground burrow. 


Habitat
Marten habitat varies, but they seem to prefer heavily forested areas. 


Habits
Marten are extremely agile and active predators, spending much time in the tree tops.  They 
feed on chipmunks, squirrels, mice, rabbits, shrews, moles, small birds, berries and nuts. 

Amphibians, reptiles, and insects are also eaten occasionally. 

Although they are often considered nocturnal, marten may be active at any time of the day. 
They are solitary except during the breeding season and while young are with the female. 

Marten are active throughout the year, but they may den during periods of severe weather. 
They may give off a foul musk when disturbed. 

Trapping	Tactics

Marten pelts are most prime at the same time as fisher, in November and December. 

In general, marten sets are similar to those used for fisher. Cubby sets and leaning pole sets are 
most frequently used. Size 1½ foothold traps and medium or small (double spring) body‐gripping 
traps may be used effectively. Box traps also can be useful in trapping marten. 


Baits	and	Lures
Marten musk and urine, fish oil, skunk essence, jam, sardines, and beaver castor are attractive 

to marten. A good lure can increase the drawing power of baited sets, particularly during cold

73,"Chapter	10	Common	Water	Sets



Many new trappers start by trapping semi‐aquatic furbearers such as muskrat and mink.  
Raccoon, which are less aquatic, can also be taken in water sets. The sets presented in this 
chapter are useful for those species as well as for beaver and otter. Body‐gripping traps or 

submersion sets should    be used whenever possible for water trapping. Where body‐gripping 
traps are not useable and the water is not deep enough to submerge muskrat and mink, always 
use guarded foothold traps to prevent animals from escaping. Be certain your traps are 

anchored or staked solidly enough to hold the strongest animal you may catch, in this case, 
beaver or otter.  

The depth of water that covers a trap is dependent on the species being targeted.  For muskrat, 

mink, otter and raccoon, one to two inches of water covering the trap is usually sufficient.  For 
beaver, the trap may need to be placed in much deeper water, especially if the trapper is trying 
to catch the beaver by a back foot. 

Submersion sets for muskrat and mink need not be 

elaborate. Stake the trap in deep water (12 to 18 
inches) or use a sliding wire or cable to let the 

animal  reach deep water. Make sure the trap is 
firmly anchored since raccoon are often taken in 
sets made for muskrat and mink. Beaver and otter 

require the use of a one‐way sliding lock on a strong 
wire or cable. Sliding locks can be made using angle 
iron, bent washers, or  double swivel bodies. 

Commercial “drowning locks” and cables are also 
available. 

Feedbed	Sets

Muskrats create feedbeds which actually are piles of 
food cuttings. These piles can be easily distinguished 
from muskrat lodges because the feedbed is barely 

above the waters surface whereas lodges are 
several feet in height. Muskrats are caught at these 
feedbeds by foothold traps set in 1 to 2 inches of  

water in front of the pile. The trap should be 
attached to a submersion wire if the water is more 
than a foot deep. If the water is less than 1 foot 

deep, use a guarded foothold trap on a slide wire to

74,"Float	Set
Muskrat and some other 
aquatic animals tend to climb 

up on floating logs or other 
surface objects. The trapper 

can take advantage of that 
behavior by using existing 
floating logs or by building a 

small floating platform and 
concealing traps where the 
animal will trigger them. 

Several designs are 
illustrated. When  such sets 

are used in a foot or more of water, the weight of the trap will submerge the muskrat. The 
trapper can avoid catching waterfowl by placing a crossed pair of branch hoops about 6 inches 
over the float as illustrated.  Consider using only one trap at each float et to lessen the chance 

of birds of prey being captured accidentally if attracted by a catch. 

Channel	Set

Most semi‐aquatic furbearers follow well‐defined trails under water. Since the animal 
commonly goes through restricted spaces, body‐gripping traps of adequate sizes are ideal for 
                                                          trapping these channels. Where the 

                                                          channel is too wide to guide the animal 
                                                          into the trap, it may be fenced or 

                                                          otherwise constricted using   brush and 
                                                          similar natural materials. The trap is 
                                                          usually more effective if placed at the 

                                                          bottom of the channel. Mink will be 
                                                          taken occasionally in channel sets for 
                                                          muskrat. Beaver are effectively trapped 

                                                          in their channels, and otter may be

Bank	Hole	Set
Muskrat dig bank dens along streams, rivers, ponds 
and lakes. These dens may look like small 

underwater woodchuck burrows. Foothold traps can 
be used to capture muskrat at bank den entrances, 

but body‐gripping traps are usually easier to use at 
the set location.  No bait or lure is needed. 

Trail	Sets

Many water animals travel the same trail each time they pass over a given spot. Blind, unbaited 
sets in these trails are often very productive. They are also selective if properly placed. Muskrats 
can be taken by concealing a foothold trap underwater where their trails are evident. The trap 

should be  placed so that the animal’s foot comes between rather than over the jaws as it 
                                                            approaches. Muskrat lure can be placed 

                                                            above the trap to enhance the set, but 
                                                            it is not necessary. Be sure to follow the 
                                                            precautions for submerging the animal 

                                                            or use a guarded trap or small  body‐
                                                            gripping trap if deep water is not 
                                                            available. 


                                                            Beaver and otter can be taken at trails 
                                                            using a strong foothold trap carefully 
                                                            concealed in 3 to 4 inches of water at 

                                                            the base of the trail. The use of a sliding 
                                                            lock and submerging wire is essential

76,"Pocket	Set
The pocket set will take mink, muskrat, 
and raccoon quite effectively. An 

upward‐sloping hole is dug into the 
stream bank such that the back of the 

hole is above the waterline and the base 
of the hole at the entrance is 2 to 3 
inches below the waterline. For mink    and 

muskrat, the hole should be about 6 
inches in diameter and 12 inches deep. 
Pockets for raccoon can be made as 

much as twice that size, but it is not 
necessary. For mink and muskrat, either 

body‐gripping or foothold traps of appropriate size may be used. Foothold traps      should be set to 
ensure submersion of the trapped animal. For raccoon, appropriately sized foothold traps 
should be used. The pocket is baited with fish or a honey‐based bait and an appropriate lure. In 

areas where free‐ranging dogs may occur, the trapper should avoid meat baits and raccoon 
gland lures. Locating the set under low‐hanging cover, like branches or exposed tree roots, and 
keeping the trap well inside the pocket is also helpful in keeping dogs out of these sets. Muskrat 

musk and beaver castor are excellent lures for pocket sets. Traps at pocket sets can either be 
placed within the hole as shown in the accompanying drawing or, more effectively, at the 

entrance but outside the hole. And remember to anchor your traps solidly. 

Spring	Run	Set

Spring runs or small streams entering 
larger bodies of water are natural 
channels for muskrat, mink, and otter. 

Because raccoon frequently move along 
or across them, at the edge of the larger 
body of water, spring run sets should be 

made secure for raccoon as well as mink 
and muskrat. Foothold    traps of 

appropriate size and submerging wires 
should be used. In some cases, 
appropriately sized body‐gripping traps 

also may be used effectively, provided

                                                      Another type of trail set makes use of the 
                                                      way furbearers behave when they 

                                                      encounter an obstruction. Raccoon and 
                                                      mink tend to enter the water at the same 

                                                      place each time they encounter an 
                                                      obstruction on the bank, often forming a 
                                                      visible trail. Water sets at these points can 

                                                      be quite  productive. The trap should be well 
                                                      bedded and may be covered with water‐
                                                      soaked leaves or mud. A submersion set 

                                                      should be used. No bait or lure is needed.  

Scent	Mound	Set

Beaver create mud mounds and mark them with 
castor, much like fox and coyote mark prominent 
objects with urine. Use a well‐concealed trap in 3 to 4 

inches of water, with a sliding lock submersion wire. 
In situations where there is no risk of domestic 

animals encountering the trap, large   body‐grip traps 
may also be used. Placing the trap at either a natural 
or artificial scent mound is a common set for beaver in 

open water trapping. Trappers who create artificial 
scent mounds often use commercially available 

castor‐based lures or homemade lures using the 
castors of previously caught  beaver from other colonies. 

                                                      A variation of the scent mound set is the 

                                                      open‐water baited beaver set. Instead of 
                                                      using a scent mound to attract beaver, the 
                                                      trapper places bait such as fresh poplar 

                                                      sticks to entice the animal into or over the 
                                                      trap. The same traps mentioned for scent 
                                                      mound sets may be used (follow the same 

                                                      precautions to avoid trapping domestic

                                                      The addition of a good lure may be helpful 
                                                      but is often unnecessary with a well‐

78,"Spillway	Set
Beaver, muskrat, and otter often use the same path or spillway to cross a beaver dam. Where 
legal, traps can be set in such places (refer to regulations in the New York State Hunting and 

Trapping Guide for specifics on setting on or near a beaver dam). Foothold traps should be set as 
described previously for trail sets. If body‐gripping traps are used, they must be set in the water 

(generally below the dam in the spillway).   















 


Under‐	Ice	Baited	Beaver	Set
Many beaver are trapped under the ice by using 
fresh bait such as poplar. Either foothold or body‐

gripping traps may be used. A hole is chopped 
into the ice near where the beaver lives or feeds, 

but not within 15 feet of a beaver den/house or 
beaver dam in some     areas (refer to your trapping 
regulations guide for specifics). Then a trap and 

bait are fastened on a dry pole, placed through 
the hole in the ice, and pushed deep into the muddy bottom. The top of the pole is anchored 

above the ice to a cross pole that cannot be pulled through the hole in the ice. If a foothold trap 
is used, it should be secured to the lower portion of the pole in a manner that prevents the 
beaver from reaching the hole in the ice and getting air, thus killing the beaver faster. Where 

stable ice conditions  occur, under‐ice baited sets are an excellent and highly selective method

A	precautionary	note	on	the	use	of	body‐grip	traps	on	land.

Body‐gripping traps are designed to kill the animals they catch. Due to this, trappers must 
exercise extreme caution when using them on land to avoid the unintentional capture of 
domestic animals or other wildlife species. Beginning trappers should seek help from an 

experienced trapper when using body‐gripping traps on       land for the first time. 

As a result of several incidents involving the unintentional capture of dogs, the Department of 
Environmental Conservation enacted strict regulations governing the use of body‐grip traps on 

land. These regulations are very specific and complex, therefore, descriptions of the 
specifications of the regulation, with graphics, can be found in Appendix 4. If after reviewing 
these materials, you still have questions, contact your local Environmental Conservation Officer, 

Regional Wildlife office, or talk to a trapper experienced in the use of body‐grip traps on land for 
clarification. 

Trappers should further note that it is illegal to use body‐grip traps larger than 7 ½ inches (“220” 
sized) on land. Learn how to properly measure the size of body‐grip traps to be sure your 

equipment is legal to use. Your adherence to these regulations and responsible use of these 
traps will help to ensure their continued  use on the trap line. 

Cubby	Sets

Cubbies can be used effectively for land species that will enter a closed space (shown on page 
75). They work well for weasel, skunk, raccoon, opossum, fisher, marten, mink and even bobcat. 
They are not effective for fox or coyote. Cubbies are containers or boxes that prevent the animal 

from approaching    a bait or lure from any side except that guarded by the trap. Hollow logs or 
trees, stumps and drain tiles are natural cubbies. A trapper may construct others of sticks, logs, 
bark or rocks. Cubby sets can be made using body‐gripping or foothold traps. If using body‐grip

Weasel	Box	Set
A small wooden box with holes cut in the 
ends is an excellent weasel cubby. The 

holes should be about 2½ to 3 inches in 
diameter. The box can be baited with 

grain (to attract mice), bloody bait, 
weasel scent, or a combination of those 
baits. Solidly staked under‐spring or  long 

spring traps in sizes 0 to 1 ½ with a very 
light pan tension are appropriate. Small body‐grip traps may also be used. A large rock placed on

82,"Raccoon	Boxes
                                        Another type of cubby can be used effectively for raccoon. 
                                        An open‐ended wooden box about 9 x 9 inches, with its 

                                        opening guarded by a medium‐sized body‐gripping trap, is 
                                        placed vertically on a tree no more than 6 inches above 

                                        the ground (see Appendix 4). The cubby can be held in 
                                        place by staples or light wire.  Bending the springs puts 
                                        tension against the notches holding the trap in place. The 

                                        trap must be at least 4 inches up inside the box. Baits of 
                                        fish, beaver castor, or honey with anise can be used. This 
                                        set can take domestic cats, so it should not be used where 

                                        there is danger of catching them. Be sure the box is 
securely fastened to a tree. 


Box	or	Cage	Traps
Box traps are self‐contained cubbies. Thus they can be 
used effectively for the animals that will enter an 

enclosed space. In many cases, carefully covering the 
box trap will make the set more effective and also may 

help in hiding it from thieves. In most instances, the 
bait should be  placed behind the treadle or trigger. 
Single‐door traps may work better than those with double doors, particularly for raccoon, 

marten, and fisher. Though expensive, box or cage traps are good options in areas where there 
is risk of an unintentional capture as the animal will be alive and can  be released. 


Scent	Post	Set
                                         Like domestic dogs, coyote and fox urinate on prominent 
                                         objects along their lines of travel. Trappers can take 

                                         advantage of that habit to catch these furbearers. 
                                         Raccoon, skunk and opossum also may investigate scent 

                                         post sets for fox. A small prominent object, like a 
                                         protruding stone, grass tuft, or stick serves as the post. A 
                                         liberal amount of fox urine and a few drops of gland lure 

                                         are placed on it. The trap is carefully bedded and 
                                         concealed a few inches away from the post, so that the 
                                         animal will step on it while urinating. Traps should be

83,"Flat	Set
The flat set is quite similar to the scent post set. No bait 
hole or post is used, but the set is lured and liberally 

sprayed with fox urine. The flat set is an excellent choice 
where fox are acting shy of dirt‐hole sets. 


Dirt‐Hole	Sets
The dirt‐hole set is an extremely good producer for nearly 
all predatory furbearers. Making dirt‐hole sets for fox and 

coyote is challenging, and the instructions below are 
written for that type of set. Site selection is all important. 

The set should be made in a relatively open spot where 
visibility is good on all sides. Naturally, fox activity should be evident in the area. 

After selecting the site, all equipment should be prepared, and 

the trapper should go directly to the spot. The bait hole should 
be dug near a clump of weeds, a rock, a small stump, or some 
similar backstop. It should be about 2‐1/2 to 4inches in 

diameter, 6 to 8 inches deep, sloping back about 60 degrees 
under the backstop. All dirt removed should be placed in the 
sifter.  


Next, a triangle of sod about 8 to 10 inches on each side is removed in     front of the hole. The 
point of the triangle should touch the hole, giving it the appearance of a fox‐dug food cache. Dirt 

is removed from the triangle until the trap bed is sufficient for the trap to sit below the surface.  

The trap is staked so that the stake and chain will be directly 
under it. After the stake is driven, pull hard on the chain. If the 

stake moves, the trap is inadequately anchored. Either add an 
additional stake, use an earth anchor, or move the set to a 
location where the stake will hold adequately. Cover the stake 

                                 and excess chain with a smooth 
                                 layer of earth and bed the trap 
                                 carefully but firmly. The trap 

                                 should not rock or shift position. In wet or freezing weather, the 
                                 trap should be bedded in dry sand, ant‐hill dirt, or an anti‐freeze 

                                 may be used. Anti‐freezes    which are used include salt, calcium 
                                 chloride, or commercial products. When using salt or calcium

84,"After adding the pan cover (if used), the trapper can cover the 

trap with sifted soil. The soil should be level, and the trap should 
be buried about 1/2 inch below the surface. The trap pan should 

be as close to the front of the bait hole as possible. 

The set is completed by placing bait in the hole and adding a few 
drops of lure on the backstop (often a clump of grass or stump). 

Fox urine is then squirted behind the hole and the trapper leaves 
the area as undisturbed as possible.  





                                                                       

                                                                       

                                                                      For coyote and bobcat, the set 

is made a bit larger with larger traps and the trapper may wish to position the trap farther away 
from the hole. When trapping strictly for raccoon, raccoon lure may be used, and fox urine is 

unnecessary. Skunk and opossum may also be caught in these sets. Mink are sometimes            taken 
at dirt‐hole sets. They are also effective for fisher and marten. 

Spring‐Hole	Set

The spring‐hole set is 
effective for raccoon and fox. 

It takes advantage of the 
habit of the                   fox to 
avoid wet feet. A site with 

permanent water (preferably 
a non‐freezing spring), several 

inches deep and 3' or more 
wide is selected. A large piece 
of moss‐covered rock or    sod is 

placed about 12"" out from the 
bank. A second, smaller rock or sod, fitted to the inside of the trap jaws, is placed about halfway 
from the bank edge to the bait sod. The trap and drag should be concealed below the surface, 

but the “stepping stone” should    be above the water and stable on the pan. The trap should be 
adjusted so that the pan is level and rather stiff in action. Bait and lure placed on the bait sod 

should be carefully hidden to prevent birds from stealing the bait or getting into the set. Spring‐

85,"Leaning‐Pole	or	Running	Pole	Set
A second “dog‐resistant” set for raccoon, fisher, 
marten, and gray fox is the leaning‐pole set. A bait 

(fish or beaver or raccoon meat are good choices) 
and lure (generally something with skunk essence 

in it) are placed at the top end of the pole. The trap 
is placed lower  on the pole, but at least 4' above 
the ground (see Appendix 4). Medium body‐

gripping traps can be stapled (the jaw nearest the 
bait) to the pole or placed on a trap holder.  You 
may wish to move the trigger to the side to 

prevent small mammals such as     squirrels from 
springing the trap. A pan‐type trigger is 

commercially available, and very useful in this set. 
The trapper must be sure the animal will not be 
suspended above the ground by extending the 

anchoring system (typically a chain, cable, and/or 
wire) enough to allow the captured animal to fall   
to the ground or by directly and firmly attaching the trap to the tree or pole. 


Cover the bait such that it is not visible from above to avoid the risk of attracting birds to the 
set. This set can catch domestic cats so the trapper should avoid using it where they may be 

found. 

The sets described in this chapter cover the basics for land trapping. Variations on these sets 
abound. Trappers can learn more about other land sets by reading trapping magazines and 

books, tagging along with experienced trappers, or by watching demonstrations at trappers

86,"Chapter	12	Running	a	Trapline



 

Trapping is a serious responsibility that takes hard work and dedication on the part of the 
trapper. Once the traps are set, the trapper cannot take a day off. Remember, by law, traps 
must be checked daily (48 hours in some areas) and besides, it’s the ethical thing to do. Trapping 

with a partner can help to alleviate the demands of running the trapline by allowing you to 
alternate trap check days. 

Don’t bite off more than you can chew. If you only have to time to effectively operate 10 traps, 

don’t set 12! If you are only capable of skinning and fleshing two or three animals each night, 
don’t set so many traps that you end up catching five or six. Finally, don’t over trap an area. Your 
pre‐season scouting will give you a sense of the numbers of your intended animals on your trap 

line. Setting goals for each species can be fun and a big aid in keeping you focused and 
energized, but you must be realistic when establishing your goals. If you only have access to one 
small pond, hoping to catch 100 muskrats is unrealistic. 


Obtain	Permission             

If you’re planning to trap on private lands, getting landowner permission is a must.  This is best 

done well in advance of the trapping season during the spring and summer months. Part of the 
process is marketing yourself, so dress neatly when asking for permission. Be polite even if you 
are denied access to a property. 

If you are granted permission to access the property, ask the 

landowner about possible problems with certain furbearers 
such as beavers flooding fields or access roads, raccoons 
damaging corn crops, or coyotes and fox preying on livestock. 

Ask if neighboring properties are also experiencing these 
problems. Make certain you know      which portions of the 

property you have permission to access and see if there are 
periods during the season when your permission may not 
apply. 

Work out an agreed‐upon schedule with the landowner for pre‐season scouting and actual 

trapping. Let the landowner know which vehicle you will be driving and provide your contact 
information so the landowner can alert you to changes or maybe even if your traps have made a 
catch. Finally, contact the landowner again shortly before the season begins to check for things

87,"Pre‐season	Scouting             

                                 After you have obtained landowner permission, pre‐season 
                                 scouting should be completed.  Taking a tour of your trapping 

                                 properties will give you a sense of what animals are available for 
                                 you to trap and how many you can reasonably expect to catch. 
                                 Taking the time now to identify primary travel    areas of your 

                                 intended species will save you countless hours on the trapline 
                                 while you are setting traps. 


The	Checking	Schedule               

After the traps are set, the trapper waits in eager anticipation. Since most furbearers are active 
at night, the responsible trapper checks traps early each morning for several important reasons:  


            The time an animal is held in a trap is kept to a 
             minimum which could reduce any stress      on the part 
             of the trapped animal. 

            A trapped animal is less likely to escape. 

            A trapped animal is less likely to be stolen. 

If a trapper is going to school, he or she should try to quickly 

check all of their sets in the morning before school and remove 
their catch. After school, revisit the trapline and reset traps that 
had a catch in the morning, scout for new sets and try to recheck 

as many other sets as time allows. This checking schedule is 
good for all three reasons listed above, plus it gives advantages 
over someone who just checked traps once a day.       The trapper who checks traps before and 

after school will have more time to make better and more selective sets, which should result in 
a larger catch of intended furbearers and reduce the chance of catching unintended animals. 

Before checking a trapline, the trapper should have the necessary equipment and knowledge to 

properly handle any captured animal.  If using foothold traps on land, the trapper should have 
the proper equipment for killing a intended animal and for releasing unintended animals, and 

the knowledge to properly use these tools. 

When actually checking a trap, the trapper should always approach close enough to the set to

88,"especially the area around the set for signs of a visit. A trapper can often learn a lot by studying 

such visits. If a dog, cat, or human is visiting the set, the trapper would probably want to move 
the trap to a new location. If a fox visited the set, the trapper might want to use another type of 

bait or lure. These tips can be valuable to a beginning trapper to reduce the catch of unintended 
animals and increase the catch of intended animals. 

Releasing	Unintended	Animals

Occasionally, unintended animals are captured. When this occurs, the trapper must release the 

creature quickly but without danger to himself. There are 
several different methods of releasing these unintended 

animals. A catchpole can be placed around the animal’s 
neck to control it while the trap is removed.  Make the 
loop snug  but be careful not to choke the animal.  One 

suggestion to avoid this problem is to position the loop so 
that a free front leg and shoulder is included in the  loop.  

Firm pressure will keep the animal from biting you while 
you release its leg from the trap.  A turdy forked stick may 
also be used in place of the loop to hold the animal’s head securely while it is being released.  

Some trappers use a large piece of fabric (such as a heavy square of canvas or a heavy coat, etc.) 
to place over the trapped animal, leaving the   trapped foot exposed.  Then the fabric is held 
down along the trapped limb by kneeling or standing on the fabric (of course, being careful not 

to step on the animal). Finally, the trap is quickly removed and the animal is released. As 
mentioned previously in Chapter 6, a board with a V‐notch cut into it may also be used to 

release unintended and other unwanted animals. 

Releasing animals is always easier with a partner. Young trappers should always get help before 
releasing unintended animals. 


The trapper should carefully evaluate the set type and placement to avoid catching domestic 
animals. The ethics of trapping insist on this, and it is always wise to place sets where no dogs or 
cats are seen close by. However, accidents can still happen and if you do catch a dog or cat, you 

should make every effort to contact the owner of the pet to    make them aware of the situation. 

By learning proper techniques and methods trappers can become extremely selective and the 
capture of unintended animals can virtually be eliminated.             


Killing	Trapped	Animals

Editor’s Note: This section was written to introduce the reader to methods of killing furbearers. 
No attempt has been made to make this seem easier, nicer, or more difficult than it really is. If 

the reader finds this section disturbing, then perhaps the reader should not attempt to trap land

89,"until he or she felt that they could kill a furbearer by striking it on the head or until they were 

old enough to use a firearm. Just as trapping is not for everyone, land trapping may not be for 
every trapper.   


New or young trappers should only pursue animals which they can easily and safely kill.  If you 
catch any animal that you cannot safely handle, GET HELP. Asking for the help of an experienced 
trapper or parent is the smart thing to do. It will help you harvest the animal humanely, prevent 

wounding it, and avoid risking injury.   

There are several humane ways to kill trapped furbearers. It should be done as quickly and 

humanely as possible while not endangering yourself with the animal’s teeth, claws, or scent 
glands. The best way to kill a trapped furbearer depends on several different factors such as the 
species of furbearer, the type of trap used, and the trapper. The use of body‐gripping traps and 

submersion sets can keep the need for killing water animals to a minimum. If a live furbearer is 
encountered, it may be quickly and humanely killed by striking sharply on the head or by 

shooting. 

Shooting is a very effective way to kill furbearers if the trapper is old enough to legally carry a 
firearm. A well placed shot using a .22 rim‐fire cartridge aimed to pass through the front of the 

brain into the body of the animal is fatal and quick. Opossum have a very small brain placed low 
in the head, so they should be shot at the base of the ear or down through the midline of the 
skull. Skunk may be prevented from spraying their musk if they are shot through the lungs in the 

chest region. Head and spine shots    usually result in their releasing musk. Furbearers held in both 
foothold and cage traps may be safely shot. 


Always be careful that the bullet does not strike the ground, a rock, or the trap and ricochet. If 
more than one person is present, they should all stand behind the shooter. 

If using a firearm to dispatch furbearers is not an option for you, another method will have to be 

used. Most furbearers can be quickly and humanely killed by first sharply striking them at the 
base of the skull with a heavy wooden or metal tool. It is highly recommended that       the animal 

be struck two times, once to render it unconscious and again to render it either dead or 
comatose. To ensure death, pin the head with one foot and stand on the chest (area near the 
heart) of the animal with the other foot for several minutes. The trapper should never attempt 

to stand on a conscious animal and should not step off of an unconscious animal until it is dead. 
To be sure the furbearer is dead, the trapper can touch the eye or mouth of the animal with the 

striking tool and watch for any reaction. If there  is no reaction and then if the trapper does not 
detect any breathing or heart beats, the animal can be assumed dead. The trapper must be 
especially careful with opossum because it is often difficult to detect its reactions, breathing or 

heart beats. The larger furbearers such as raccoon, coyote,    and bobcat may be too large for 
some beginners to safely kill using this method. If this is the case, seek assistance in killing larger

90,"Skunk should be approached quietly with the wind blowing from you to the skunk. Many 

trappers talk softly to the skunk and stop approaching when it raises its tail. When close enough, 
strike the skunk as mentioned earlier. However, its tail will twitch and the skunk will spray its 

musk. The power of this musk and the ability of skunk to spray it should not be taken lightly. 
Skunk musk is very strong and can cause vomiting, burning of the eyes or at the very least, 

smelly clothes.  

If releasing unintended or killing intended animals seems challenging to you, do not set traps on 
land. Focus your efforts on trapping water animals with body‐grip traps and submersion sets

Equipment

If you have properly prepared your traps, secured landowner permission, been thorough in your 
pre‐season scouting, and made selective trap sets in the right locations, you’ll soon have need 
for your fur handling equipment. The equipment you will need will depend upon how you plan 

to sell your catch, whether  in the round (whole and un‐skinned), green (skinned but not fleshed, 
stretched and dried) or fleshed, stretched, and dried. 

Assuming you plan to sell your catch other than in the round 
(whole and unskinned), you will need some good quality knives 

and means of keeping them sharp. While nearly any knife will 
do, there are many good options available for handling 
furbearers. You may find it useful to have more than one knife 

while skinning, using one knife for beginning cuts and another 
for finishing cuts around the head where the blade frequently 
contacts bone. Two important factors are that    the knife has a 
blade that can take and hold a sharp edge and that is has a comfortable grip that fits your hand 

                                well.  

                                There are also several options available for knife‐sharpening 
                                equipment, from simple whet stones to diamond‐impregnated 
                                stones, even powered knife sharpeners. Over time, you’ll figure 

                                out which type will best suit your needs.  

 

You may find it easier to skin the animal while it is hanging. A gambrel is 
designed for this purpose. The gambrel will have two loops into which the 
hind feet of the animal are placed. A piece of wood or metal between the 

loops keeps the legs spread wide enough to make skinning around them 
easier. Commercial models are available, or the trapper may choose to 
make one using rope, chain, or cable. A swivel in the line the gambrel 

hangs from allows the trapper to spin the animal while skinning    to get at

93,"Brushes, combs, and even a fork are useful in removing burrs and dirt from the pelt prior to 

skinning. Animals with furred tails must have the bone removed (for beaver, muskrat, and 
opossum, the tail is simply removed) and the tail split open on some species (refer to Appendix 

5 for specifics for each furbearer).  Commercial tail stripping tools are available, or the trapper 
may choose to use a clothespin or a couple of nails. Specially designed tail‐slitting knives and 

guides are also available (the guide ensures a straight cut).  











 

Once the pelt is free from the carcass, it can be double bagged and frozen or it will need to be 
fleshed to remove excess fat and muscle before being placed on the stretcher. For many 

species, a fleshing beam will make this process easier while for some species, like muskrat, a 
small tapered board that can be cradled     in the trapper’s lap will be sufficient. With either the 

beam or simple board, the pelt is turned inside out and placed over the device so the fat and 
meat may be scraped off. The trapper may choose either a single‐handled scraper or a double‐
handled draw knife. For   easily fleshed species like muskrat, an old kitchen spoon will work fine.  


 

 

 


Once the pelt is properly fleshed, it will need to be placed on a stretcher. Both solid wood and 
metal wire stretchers are available. Some species end up looking better if stretched on one 
rather than the other, but which type of stretcher to use is really a matter of trapper and fur 

buyer or fur market preference. A smart trapper will consult the fur buyer for the preferred way 
to put up different                     animals

Unlike most furbearers, beaver require special “stretchers.” The 
trapper can choose from flat plywood boards with various‐sized 

patterns traced onto them or adjustable metal hoop stretchers 
that can be made larger or smaller to accommodate different‐
sized beaver. Again, trapper preference will be the determining 

factor in which type is used. If you have the chance, try both and 
work with the one that best suits you.  


 

Techniques

Proper fur handling is very important. It can bring much more 
personal satisfaction from doing a job well, and it can also result in a better price from the fur 

buyer. Fur handling starts at the trap site. If trapped in the water, the dead furbearer should be 
rinsed clean of  any mud or vegetation. This can usually be accomplished by moving the 

furbearer head first through the cleanest water available. Attempt to remove as much excess 
water as possible. Muskrat can be held by the head and shaken or gently whipped to remove 
much of the water. Furbearers can also    be stroked with your hand from the head to the tail to 

squeeze out water or rolled in the snow to clean and soak up excess water. If they are carried in 
a vehicle, they can be placed on newspaper or small furbearers such as muskrat can be wrapped 

in newspapers   to help absorb moisture. A clean burlap bag helps clean and dry any furbearer as 
it is being carried from the set. 

If the animal’s fur is still wet later, it should be hung up by the head or forelegs in a cool place to 

finish drying. Be sure not to hang too long since the pelt may spoil in warm weather. All pelts 
must be dry before being placed on a drying frame. Directing an oscillating fan onto the animal 
can aid greatly in the fur drying process. 


If the furbearer is not trapped in the water, it should not be rinsed unless the fur is very wet and 
muddy. If rinsing is necessary, be sure to dry the fur as mentioned above. Keep the fur dry and 
brush or comb it to remove any burrs or dirt before skinning. A missed burr or clump of dirt can 

lead to a torn pelt during fleshing. 

Watch out for parasites such as fleas, ticks and mites that may be on the animal’s fur (especially 
land furbearers). It is advisable to wear plastic gloves when skinning. 


Furbearers should be skinned as soon as possible after they are killed. The skin is easier to 
remove when the animal is fresh, and damage to the pelt is less likely. For practice, it is a good

95,"Skinning	Cased	Fur
There are two recognized ways of skinning animals, and these are called “cased” and “open.” All 
fur except beaver are prepared cased. Cased furs are removed from the animal by slitting the fur 

across from one hind foot pad to the other and pulling it down over the animal’s head the way 
we take off a pullover sweater. Animals with furred tails have the tail split on the underside and 

left on the pelt. Hairless tails, like those of muskrat, beaver and opossum, are removed at the 
hair line. 

A good example of skinning a cased fur is the raccoon. The first 

step in skinning a raccoon is to cut the pelt around the ankles 
and wrists where the long fur ends. Next, the pelt is cut from the 
heel of each hind foot to the vent and around the vent. Finally, a 

cut is made from the vent straight down the     tail about one‐
quarter of the way. Start peeling the pelt down the hind legs by 
pulling the pelt and by cutting connective tissue where 

necessary. After the pelt is removed from the hind legs, the 
carcass can be hung at a convenient height by its hind feet. Peel 

                                  the pelt off the carcass around 
                                  the vent. If the raccoon is a male, 
                                  reproductive organs will be 

                                  connected to the pelt. These are cut off as close to the pelt as 
                                  possible. Now peel the pelt from around the base of the tail 

                                  exposing a couple of inches of the tail  bone. Clamp a tail stripper 
                                  around the tail bone with one hand and hold the base of the tail 
                                  with your other hand and 

                                  attempt to pull the tail bone out 
of the tail by moving your hands apart. If the tail bone does not 
pull out, extend the cut  from the base of the tail several more 

inches towards the tip of the tail. Free part of the tail bone from 
the pelt by cutting the connective tissue and then try to pull the 

tail bone out as described before. If tail bone still refuses to pull out, extend the  cut on the tail 
to the tip and finish skinning the tail out. Even if the tail pulls out, still extend the cut on the tail 
straight to the tip. A tail‐slitting guide may be helpful. The pelt 

should now be pulled down the carcass as far as it    will go, 
exposing the forelegs. Further expose the foreleg by cutting the 

connective tissue. 

Wrap fingers from both of your hands around the raccoon’s 
foreleg. With the hand closest to the raccoon’s wrist, push the

96,"other hand. Keep pushing until the raccoon’s forefoot passes thru the pelt and the pelt is free. 

Repeat this process with the other foreleg. 

When both forelegs are free, pull the pelt down the carcass past the neck until it won’t readily 
proceed any further. The head of the carcass should now be partly exposed above the pelt. Start 

looking for the cartilage on each side of the head that attaches the ears to the skull while 
continuing to free the pelt by cutting any connective tissues. Once found, the ear cartilage 

should be cut as close as possible to   the skull. Pull the pelt lower and the connective tissue 













around the eyes should become apparent. This tissue should also be cut close to the skull. (If 

either the ears or the eyes are difficult to locate, you can clean off your gloves, to keep the fur 
clean, and feel the head inside the pelt to determine the correct location for the cut.). If done 
properly, no fur should be left on the carcass around the ears or eyes. The pelt is pulled down 

again, finally exposing the loose flesh around the lips. Now free the pelt from the carcass by     
cutting around the lips and through the nose cartilage near the pelt. The pelt is now ready to be 

fleshed or rolled fur side out and frozen in a plastic bag.  

Fleshing	Cased	Furs
Fleshing is the act of removing the muscle and fat from the skin. Check with your fur buyer 

before the season; some buyers prefer to buy un‐fleshed pelts to be fleshed by a professional. 

Before the pelt is ready to be fleshed, its fur should be dry and free of any mud or burrs.  If the 
pelt is frozen, it should be removed from the plastic bag and thawed completely but slowly 

(don’t leave it next to a stove or heater). Unfrozen pelts with a lot of fat, such as raccoon, skunk 
or opossum pelts, should be allowed to hang      fur side in to cool until the fat stiffens or hardens. 

The fleshing job is made easier by using a fleshing beam or fleshing board as described 

previously. The trapper should try to match the shape of the beam or board with the type of 
fleshing tool used. One‐handed scrapers, hog scrapers and two‐handed scrapers with a straight 

blade work well on the flatter beams and boards. A two‐handed scraper with a curved blade 
works well on a rounder beam or board. Regardless of the equipment used, care should be 
taken not to apply too much pressure on     the pelt. This could cut the hide or the roots of the fur

97,"To start fleshing, the pelt is slipped over the fleshing beam or board with the fur side in.  If the 

animal has a tail that is left on the pelt, the tail is usually fleshed first. It is important that all the 
fat be cleaned from the tail because if any is left on it may spoil or get into the fur. 

Many trappers like to flesh a narrow strip around the bottom of the pelt after fleshing the tail. 

Next, start at the head and flesh a strip down the length of the pelt. The pelt is turned or rotated 


















on the beam or board so that the trapper can flesh another strip alongside the first strip. The 

pelt is turned until all of it has been fleshed. A sharp knife can be used to trim around the lips, 
eyes and ears. Forelegs should also be checked for fat and fleshed if necessary. A clean dry rag, 
feed bag, hardwood sawdust, or a paper towel can be used to soak up extra grease or loose fat. 

Some furbearers, especially red fox and weasel, will only have a small amount of flesh or fat on 
the pelt and it will onlybe necessary to scrape where the trapper sees flesh or fat. 


Stretching	or	Boarding	Cased	Furs
After a pelt is fleshed, it must be held in the proper shape by a drying board or stretcher until 
the flesh side of the pelt is dry. There are several different types of stretchers. For many species 

such as muskrat, raccoon, opossum, skunk and fox, wire stretchers are highly preferred        by 
trappers and fur buyers. Wooden stretchers are also used. However, 

they should have smooth, tapered and nicely curved edges except 
for their base. Remember to use a belly board or wedge with any 
non‐adjustable wooden stretcher or the pelt may not come off the 

stretcher without being ripped   or cut. 

The desired shape and dimensions of stretchers can change over 
time depending on demands of the fur market. 


Wire	Stretchers
Cased furs are always arranged on stretchers in such a way that the

98,"the eyes, ears and back will be centered on the other side. Place the pelt fur side in on the 

stretcher, centered as described, and pull the pelt down the stretcher until snug. Wire stretchers 
usually have two or more arms that move up and down the stretcher. These arms are attached 

(pronged) into the edge of the hide in the center of the stretcher. Muskrat pelts are attached at 
the tail and belly portions of the pelt, each on a separate arm. All other cased pelts have the tail 
portion of the pelt attached to one arm and the     two hind feet attached to the other arm. The 

arms are pulled towards the bottom of the stretcher until snug. The pelt is then wiped clean 
again and is ready to dry. 


Wooden	Stretchers
Place the pelt on the board fur side in. Starting below the front legs, push the belly of the pelt 
slightly toward the head with your thumbs and at the same time pull the back of it slightly down 

towards the tail with your fingers. Keep doing this all the way   down to the bottom of the pelt. 
This will make the belly shorter and lengthen the back making a better inspection‐area window 
yet not thinning the fur 


Now, turn the board over with the back of the pelt facing up. With the board sitting this way, 
start at the root of the tail to stretch the tail wide and, at the same time, push it towards the 

rump to shorten the tail. Do this all the way to the tip of the tail, then work back again. This 
makes a better‐looking job of the inspection‐area window and thickens        the fur instead of 
thinning it, which happens when the tail is stretched out lengthwise. 


Now with the pelt placed smoothly and evenly on the board with the tail well cleaned and 
opened, it can be fastened to the board with a few tacks or push pins around the skirt and a few 
along the edge of the tail. Cut off the lower lip. Let the skin of the front legs stick out free from 

the pelt. Do not fold the front legs together nor turn them back inside the pelt as either way can 
cause rot and the hair to  slip. The back legs of the pelt can be fastened with one or two tacks. 

Create an inspection window by trimming away some of the belly fur starting just below the 

penis opening (or same general area on females).  Trim cautiously and minimally and do not 
extend the cut into the flanks. 

A belly board should be used with the one‐

piece drying board. The belly board is 5/16"" 
by 5/16"" by 30"" and sloped or tapered from 

one end to the other so it can be removed 
after the pelt is dry. Place the smallest end 
between the drying board and the pelt on 

the belly side and push it ahead until the 
belly board goes up to the head of the pelt.

99,"Drying	Cased	Furs
After the pelt has been boarded, it should be hung to dry in a place away from the stove, 
sunlight or strong hot winds. If it is dried too fast, the leather will be ruined. A temperature of 55 

to 60 degrees F (13 to 15 degrees C) is about right. Protect drying pelts from pests such as mice.  

The pelts will dry in 24 to 60 hours, depending on the amount of air movement passing through 
the drying place. They should be wiped with a dry, clean rag occasionally to take off sweat and 

any fat that might work out of the leather. When the pelts have been on the drying board long 
enough to dry, they should be taken off and hung by the nose until the head and legs are fully 

dry before selling. Cased pelts should not be folded, but should be packed flat, one on top of      the 
other. Folding makes a crease and takes away some of the good appearance.  

Pelts of foxes, coyotes, fisher, marten and bobcat should be turned fur‐side out before final 

drying. This is best done after the pelts have been on the stretchers for 24 hours or less and the 
leather is dry to the touch but still pliable. Check on the drying pelt repeatedly well in advance of 
the 24 hours to ensure the pelt does not become too dry prior to turning. If you wait too long, 

turning the pelt will be difficult and could result in damaged or torn leather. If this happens, 
moisten the leather with damp rags until it becomes pliable again. Be careful to not over‐

moisten the leather as this could encourage the growth of mold on the leather and reduce the 
overall value of the pelt. 

Appendix 5 contains specifics for how the fur of each species is prepared, including appropriate 

stretcher sizes. 

Skinning	Open	Fur	(Beaver)
                             The beaver is the only furbearer in New York that is skinned open. 

                             The fur handling process up to skinning is the same as for other 
                             furbearers, that is, the animal should be clean and dry. Lay the 

                             beaver on its back and stroke the fur from its chin to its   tail. Then, 
                             use an index finger to mark a straight line from the base of the 
                             beaver’s tail 

                             to its chin. 
                             Be sure the 
                             line is 

                             straight. Cut 
                             along the 

                             line from tail 
to chin being careful to cut only 
through the skin, particularly around 

the vent and in the  vicinity of the

100,"line. The tail can be removed in a similar fashion; but most trappers simply cut the skin around 

the base of the tail, since it makes an excellent handle. 

Start pulling and cutting the skin free from the carcass along the midline cut. Take care not to 
cut the castors located on either side of the midline just above the vent (these may be removed 

and dried for sale or used in making lures). When the fat layer gives way to a layer of flesh, cut 
deeper, leaving the flesh on the pelt. Take care around the legs so that     the skin is not cut, and 

continue to cut and pull the pelt free. When the skin is loose from the underside of the animal, 
flip it over and complete the skinning job. Take care around the lips, nose, eyes, and ears. On 
beaver, the ears are connected to the skull by a cartilage and a boney canal. Carefully cut at the 

base of the cartilage. Then skin out the rest of the upper jaw and nose. After the pelt is free, it is 
ready to be fleshed and dried or frozen. To freeze a beaver pelt, fold the pelt in    half (leather side 

to leather side), roll the pelt up, place in a heavy plastic bag and freeze. 

Fleshing	Beaver	Pelts
As mentioned earlier, the fur of beaver pelts should be dry and free of mud and burrs and the 

fat should be cooled until it stiffens or hardens. Since beaver pelts are skinned open, they can’t 
be placed on a fleshing beam or board like other pelts. However, a leg hole can be slipped over 

the tip of the fleshing beam or board. Then the area around each leg hole can be fleshed strip by 
strip as mentioned in fleshing cased furs. Next, place the pelt on a beaver stretching board by 
first fastening the nose with a nail (close to the edge of the pelt), then draw the tail tight and 

fasten it with another nail. The pelt is stretched as wide as it will go and fastened with two more 
nails. Finally, draw the pelt tight and fasten with four more nails, each halfway between the first 
four. 


Using a two‐bladed fleshing knife (one blade is dull, the other sharp), flesh a strip around the 
sides of the beaver. The remaining muscle, grizzle and fat can be fleshed either from the tail, 
head and sides to the center of the pelt, or if the muscle, grizzle and fat can be separated from 

the center of the pelt, it can be fleshed in strips from the center. On some sections of the pelt, 
fat will be easily fleshed; however, in many areas fat and flesh may have to be cut free from the 

pelt with a sharp knife (especially around the    tail and head).  As mentioned earlier, a clean dry 
rag, feedbag or a paper towel can be used as needed to soak up extra grease or loose fat. 

Boarding	Beaver	Pelts

Beaver pelts are dried in an oval shape on a large sheet of heavy plywood or a board made from 
smooth lumber. Templates are available to give the basic shapes of various sized beaver. 

Commercially available, adjustable metal wire hoops may also be used. 

It is usually better to try to estimate the best length and width of the beaver pelt before nailing 
it to the board. In order to do this, hang the pelt by the nose and measure its length (don’t pull 

on the pelt when measuring). Take this initial measurement and divide by ten.  This smaller

101,"of the pelt, and the smaller number is again subtracted from the length to determine the width 

of the pelt. For example, if the pelt measures 30"" from the tip of its nose to the tip of its tail 
when it is hanging, then 30 divided by 10 is 3. Therefore, the pelt’s length would be 26"" [30‐

(3+1)] and the width would be 23"" (26‐3). 

To correctly dry the beaver 
pelt, first remove the nose 

and lips from the pelt. Center 
it on the drying board. Then 

fasten the head end of the 
pelt by driving a nail through 
the pelt (about 1/8 inch from 

its edge) into the board. 
Next, fasten the edge of the 

tail portion of the pelt the 
length distance from the 
nose. The middle of both 

sides is then fastened the 
width distance apart. The 

pelt should still be a little 
loose and  not stretched tight. 
Draw the pelt out and fasten 

with four more nails, each 
halfway between two of the 

first four nails. These first 
eight nails should now form 

the outline for the pelt’s 
round or oval shape. 
Continue fastening the pelt 

onto the board by nailing one 
side midway between     two 

existing nails, then going to 
the opposite side of the pelt 
for the next nail. Maintain this pattern until there is no space between nails greater than four 

inches. Then fill in these spaces with nails about an inch apart. Leave the nails sticking up at least 
one inch.  The leg holes of the beaver should not be left hanging open. They give the pelt a 

rough look and could cause a loss in value. Pull the sides of each leg hole together and close

102,"Now the nailing is completed and should look like the illustration. The pelt should be wiped or 

washed clean of any bits of fat, grease or blood still on the leather. The pelt can be raised on the 
nails to let air underneath for more complete drying. 


Drying	Beaver	Pelts
As with all other types of pelts, beaver should be dried slowly in a cool place away from the 
stove, hot sunlight or hot, strong winds. As it dries, it should be wiped from time to time with a 

clean, dry rag, to take off any fat coming out of the leather. When the pelt is thoroughly dry, 
carefully pull out the nails and take the pelt off the board. Brush out the fur until it is clean and 

shiny. Some trappers leave pelts on boards until just before selling since they have a tendency 
to shrink after being taken off  the board. 

Storing	Pelts

After the pelt is completely dried, it can be removed from the stretcher and stored. Most 
trappers try to hang their pelts in a dry place away from excessive heat and where they cannot 

be damaged by animals. Be sure to wipe off any grease that might sweat out of a hide and don’t 
let grease get on the fur of any hide. Store fur to fur or leather to leather. They may be rolled up 
end to end for shipping, but, if at all possible, it is best to keep them flat. 


Marketing

The trapper has several options for how to sell furs. If you are lacking in fur handling skill or 
don’t have the space or time to do it properly, animals can be sold un‐skinned or in the round. 

Check with your local fur buyer before using this approach to ensure that he or she will purchase 
animals in this condition. Selling in the round generally means you will be paid less money for 
your furs as they will require considerable work on the part of the fur buyer to process for 

further sale. 

Selling the hides “green” is another option. With this approach, the trapper skins the animals 
that are caught but does not flesh or stretch them. The green furs are sold as they are caught or 

rolled up fur side out, placed in plastic bags and frozen. When the trapper is ready to sell, the 
furs are removed from    the freezer and thawed prior to being brought to the buyer or auction. 

Again, lower prices will be paid for green fur as they will need to fleshed and stretched before 
they are sold again. 

Most trappers prefer to sell their furs fleshed and stretched, taking as much pride in their ability 

to properly prepare a pelt as they do in catching the animal it came from. This method offers the 
trapper the most flexibility in selling the pelt as properly dried furs can be stored for longer 
periods of time. This allows the trapper to sell the pelts at the  time of his or her choosing. 

Properly handled pelts are the final step to becoming a responsible and successful trapper. 

Furs can be sold to local or “country” fur buyers, at local auctions organized by various trapper

103,"Country buyers are still found in many areas of the state. An advantage of country buyers is that 

the trapper gets to deal with the buyer personally. Most will work closely with beginning 
trappers and make suggestions on how to produce a better finished pelt. 


Local auctions are another good option. Generally held in the late fall and early spring, these 
sales tend to attract a number of fur buyers. Most local auctions charge a small commission on 
the sale of the pelts. An advantage of this approach is that buyers compete with one another, 

often increasing the price the  trapper can receive for his furs. Another advantage is the option 
to “no sale” the furs if the trapper is not happy with the offered price. At a local auction, the 

beginning trapper gets to see a large volume of furs handled by other trappers. This allows the 
beginner to  compare different pelts, how they were handled, and the prices offered for these 
different pelts.  Local auctions are a great venue for beginners to meet and talk to other 

trappers, furthering their knowledge.   

Finally, larger international auction houses are another option. These outfits typically employ 

agents who travel routes around the state with several stops where they pick up furs from 
trappers. Though these auction houses generally charge a higher commission, this is often offset 
by higher prices being paid for the furs due to the intense competition between buyers from 

several different countries.  Information about these options is often available   in magazines that 
cater to the fur harvesting community.  Upon sale of the furs and in addition to a check, the 

trapper is given a detailed accounting of each pelt, how it was graded, and what price it sold for.  
This can be a great learning tool for the beginning trapper   who generally ships few pelts and can 
match the sale information to the individual animal.  The international auction house also
